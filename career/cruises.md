Taking part in a research cruise is a great experience that should be available to all oceanographers. However, news of cruise opportunities often travels by word of mouth or email lists within institutions. If you are not directly involved in a project that has upcoming cruises, you will need to talk to project PIs to see if they need more participants. Some opportunities are more widely advertised, and we have tried to compile a list of them below.

### Transnational access call 2024 for using polar research infrastructure
The POLARIN project opened a [call](https://eu-polarin.eu/transnational-access-call-2024/) for access to major polar research infrastructure, including major research vessels. This call also targets early career scientists. Please refer to the [call](https://eu-polarin.eu/transnational-access-call-2024/) for further details.


### Call for Participation: Research cruise offshore southern Mexico aboard R/V Marcus G. Langseth

### UNOLS cruise opportunities (U.S. Only)

If you are a graduate student based at a U.S. institution you may apply to take part in research cruises aboard UNOLS vessels. To hear about opportunities you need to sign up to their mailing list. More details are available [here](https://www.unols.org/unols-cruise-opportunity-program).


### UNOLS Chief Scientist training

UNOLS occasionally run a cruise specifically designed to train chief scientists. It is open to students and early career researchers. More details [here](https://www.unols.org/nsf-unols-chief-scientist-training-cruise).


### The GO-SHIP program

Try signing up to the [GO-SHIP mailing list](http://www.go-ship.org/Join.html). This program conducts repeat hydrographic sections all over the world. They often need volunteers.

Also note that if you successfully receive a [GO-SHIP postdoctoral fellowship](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/postdoctoral-fellowships/), you will have the opportunity to be co-chief scientist aboard a GO-SHIP cruise.
