Taking part in a research cruise is a great experience that should be available to all oceanographers. However, news of cruise opportunities often travels by word of mouth or email lists within institutions. If you are not directly involved in a project that has upcoming cruises, you will need to talk to project PIs to see if they need more participants. Some opportunities are more widely advertised, and we have tried to compile a list of them below. 


## 2 opportunities for students to sail on a research cruise in the Gulf of Mexico

The Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) at the University of Miami is seeking applicants to participate in a hydrographic long-line research cruise (6 weeks) this Fall, in September-October 2021, in the Gulf of Mexico on the NOAA SHIP Ronald H. Brown, as part of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program. Duties are largely CTD/deck operations.

[Please see this announcement for details](https://t.co/dpas5tHOc5?amp=1&s=03). Deadline for applications: June 25, 2021.


## Students and Co-Chief Scientist opportunities to sail on the US GO-SHIP A13.5

US GO-SHIP will conduct a repeat hydrography section in the Atlantic Ocean, between December 2021 - March 2022 (dates to be finalized) on the GO-SHIP decadal re-occupation of the hydrographic section A13.5. (This 2021-2022 cruise is actually a re-occupation following a truncated A13.5 in 2020, due to COVID-19.)

US GO-SHIP is looking for early career scientists (high-level scientists/technicians, with PhDs or equivalent experience) with experience in physical or chemical oceanography (hydrography) who would be interested in participating on this cruise.

They are also seeking 2 students for CTD/deck operations (typically PO background), 1 student to assist with chlorofluorocarbon and SF6 (CFC) analysis (typically chemistry background), and 1 student to assist with LADCP (Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) operations.

[Please see this announcement for details](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/2021/05/12/sail-on-a135/). Deadline for applications: May 31, 2021.


## UNOLS cruise opportunities (U.S. Only)

If you are a graduate student based at a U.S. institution you may apply to take part in research cruises aboard UNOLS vessels. To hear about opportunities you need to sign up to their mailing list. More details are available [here](https://www.unols.org/unols-cruise-opportunity-program).


## UNOLS Chief Scientist training

UNOLS occasionally run a cruise specifically designed to train chief scientists. It is open to students and early career researchers. More details [here](https://www.unols.org/nsf-unols-chief-scientist-training-cruise).


## The GO-SHIP program

Try signing up to the [GO-SHIP mailing list](http://www.go-ship.org/Join.html). This program conducts repeat hydrographic sections all over the world. They often need volunteers.

Also note that if you successfully receive a [GO-SHIP postdoctoral fellowship](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/postdoctoral-fellowships/), you will have the opportunity to be co-chief scientist aboard a GO-SHIP cruise.
