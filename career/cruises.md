Taking part in a research cruise is a great experience that should be available to all oceanographers. However, news of cruise opportunities often travels by word of mouth or email lists within institutions. If you are not directly involved in a project that has upcoming cruises, you will need to talk to project PIs to see if they need more participants. Some opportunities are more widely advertised, and we have tried to compile a list of them below. 


#### New cruise opportunities for students on US GO-SHIP cruises 2021:

US GO-SHIP will conduct two repeat hydrography sections in the **North Atlantic Ocean**: between **mid March - mid April 2021 (GO-SHIP A20)** and **mid April - mid May 2021 (A22)**.

For each leg, the organizers are seeking **4 students for CTD/deck operations** (typically PO background), **1 student to assist with chlorofluorocarbon and SF6 (CFC) analysis** (typically chemistry background), and **1 student to assist with LADCP operations**, for **a total of 12 students**.

**Deadline for applications is November 15, 2020.**

## UNOLS cruise opportunities (U.S. Only)

If you are a graduate student based at a U.S. institution you may apply to take part in research cruises aboard UNOLS vessels. To hear about opportunities you need to sign up to their mailing list. More details are available [here](https://www.unols.org/unols-cruise-opportunity-program).

## UNOLS Chief Scientist training

UNOLS occasionally run a cruise specifically designed to train chief scientists. It is open to students and early career researchers. More details [here](https://www.unols.org/nsf-unols-chief-scientist-training-cruise).

## The GO-SHIP program

Try signing up to the [GO-SHIP mailing list](http://www.go-ship.org/Join.html). This program conducts repeat hydrographic sections all over the world. They often need volunteers.

Also note that if you successfully receive a [GO-SHIP postdoctoral fellowship](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/postdoctoral-fellowships/), you will have the opportunity to be co-chief scientist aboard a GO-SHIP cruise.
