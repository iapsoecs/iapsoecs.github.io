Taking part in a research cruise is a great experience that should be available to all oceanographers. However, news of cruise opportunities often travels by word of mouth or email lists within institutions. If you are not directly involved in a project that has upcoming cruises, you will need to talk to project PIs to see if they need more participants. Some opportunities are more widely advertised, and we have tried to compile a list of them below.

## I05 Co-Chief Scientist Opportunity

US GO-SHIP is seeking scientists with experience in physical or chemical oceanography (hydrography) who would be interested in participating as Co-Chief Scientist on the decadal re-occupation of the [U.S. GO-SHIP] (https://usgoship.ucsd.edu) and [GO-SHIP](http://www.go-ship.org) hydrographic long-line known as I05 (Indian Ocean 32Â°S). This expedition is about 2 months long (Fremantle to Cape Town,  July to Sept. 2023). No at-sea experience is necessary, although it can be a plus. The Chief Scientist will provide training and mentoring onboard. Preferred candidates are early career, but technicians with equivalent experience are also encouraged to apply. Further details on the cruise and application (Deadline: January 16, 2023) can be found [here](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/353/GO-SHIP_I05_2023_Co-Chief_Scientist_Opportunity_v1.pdf).

## UNOLS cruise opportunities (U.S. Only)

If you are a graduate student based at a U.S. institution you may apply to take part in research cruises aboard UNOLS vessels. To hear about opportunities you need to sign up to their mailing list. More details are available [here](https://www.unols.org/unols-cruise-opportunity-program).


## UNOLS Chief Scientist training

UNOLS occasionally run a cruise specifically designed to train chief scientists. It is open to students and early career researchers. More details [here](https://www.unols.org/nsf-unols-chief-scientist-training-cruise).


## The GO-SHIP program

Try signing up to the [GO-SHIP mailing list](http://www.go-ship.org/Join.html). This program conducts repeat hydrographic sections all over the world. They often need volunteers.

Also note that if you successfully receive a [GO-SHIP postdoctoral fellowship](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/postdoctoral-fellowships/), you will have the opportunity to be co-chief scientist aboard a GO-SHIP cruise.
