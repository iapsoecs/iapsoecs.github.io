Taking part in a research cruise is a great experience that should be available to all oceanographers. However, news of cruise opportunities often travels by word of mouth or email lists within institutions. If you are not directly involved in a project that has upcoming cruises, you will need to talk to project PIs to see if they need more participants. Some opportunities are more widely advertised, and we have tried to compile a list of them below.

### GO-SHIP cruise opportunity

US GO-SHIP is looking for students and early career scientists/technicians to participate in a summer 2023 hydrographic expedition occupying the 32S line in the Indian Ocean aboard the R/V Revelle.

The ship will depart from Fremantle Australia in late July.
After 55 days of at-sea hydrographic operations, it will arrive Cape Town South Africa in mid-September.

There are 6 positions available. Please find more information about this opportunity including the positions available and how to apply in the full advertisement [here](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/353/GO-SHIP_I05_2023_Student_Opportunity.pdf).

Deadline for applications is: February 21, 2023 (or until filled)


## UNOLS cruise opportunities (U.S. Only)

If you are a graduate student based at a U.S. institution you may apply to take part in research cruises aboard UNOLS vessels. To hear about opportunities you need to sign up to their mailing list. More details are available [here](https://www.unols.org/unols-cruise-opportunity-program).


## UNOLS Chief Scientist training

UNOLS occasionally run a cruise specifically designed to train chief scientists. It is open to students and early career researchers. More details [here](https://www.unols.org/nsf-unols-chief-scientist-training-cruise).


## The GO-SHIP program

Try signing up to the [GO-SHIP mailing list](http://www.go-ship.org/Join.html). This program conducts repeat hydrographic sections all over the world. They often need volunteers.

Also note that if you successfully receive a [GO-SHIP postdoctoral fellowship](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/postdoctoral-fellowships/), you will have the opportunity to be co-chief scientist aboard a GO-SHIP cruise.
