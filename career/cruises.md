Taking part in a research cruise is a great experience that should be available to all oceanographers. However, news of cruise opportunities often travels by word of mouth or email lists within institutions. If you are not directly involved in a project that has upcoming cruises, you will need to talk to project PIs to see if they need more participants. Some opportunities are more widely advertised, and we have tried to compile a list of them below. 


## AWI is looking for a participant on a cruise across the ACC (physical oceanographer)

AWI is looking for a physical oceanographer (e.g. a PhD Student or Postdoc) who might be interested to go on a cruise on a relatively short notice (starting October 1st). There is also an opportunity (if desired) to get participate in data analysis.

The goal of the PS133 cruise is to establish how pathways of iron in the Southern Ocean impact the primary and export production. The aim is to occupy four transects across the ACC. It is planed to occupy each of these transects twice, right after each other. The first occupation will be a high resolution section with the Triaxus towed undulating profiler (equipped with physical, biogeochemical, and biological sensors) together with VMADCP. The second occupation will be CTD stations at intermediate resolution. Those CTD stations will be covered by a regular CTD-rosette including LADCP and also by an ultra-clean CTD rosette capable of delivering samples for the measurement of iron concentrations.

The cruise will be on the German research ice breaker Polarstern departing Cape Town (South Africa) on October 1st and arriving in Punta Arenas (Chile) on November 17th. A senior physical oceanographer had to cancel her participation at short notice. Hence, they are missing crucial expertise and support for the physical oceanography.

Please email both wvonappen@awi-polarstern.de and wjvappen@awi.de if you are interested.


## 2 opportunities for students to sail on a research cruise in the Gulf of Mexico

The Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) at the University of Miami is seeking applicants to participate in a hydrographic long-line research cruise (6 weeks) this Fall, in September-October 2021, in the Gulf of Mexico on the NOAA SHIP Ronald H. Brown, as part of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program. Duties are largely CTD/deck operations.

[Please see this announcement for details](https://t.co/dpas5tHOc5?amp=1&s=03). Deadline for applications: June 25, 2021.


## Students and Co-Chief Scientist opportunities to sail on the US GO-SHIP A13.5

US GO-SHIP will conduct a repeat hydrography section in the Atlantic Ocean, between December 2021 - March 2022 (dates to be finalized) on the GO-SHIP decadal re-occupation of the hydrographic section A13.5. (This 2021-2022 cruise is actually a re-occupation following a truncated A13.5 in 2020, due to COVID-19.)

US GO-SHIP is looking for early career scientists (high-level scientists/technicians, with PhDs or equivalent experience) with experience in physical or chemical oceanography (hydrography) who would be interested in participating on this cruise.

They are also seeking 2 students for CTD/deck operations (typically PO background), 1 student to assist with chlorofluorocarbon and SF6 (CFC) analysis (typically chemistry background), and 1 student to assist with LADCP (Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) operations.

[Please see this announcement for details](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/2021/05/12/sail-on-a135/). Deadline for applications: May 31, 2021.


## UNOLS cruise opportunities (U.S. Only)

If you are a graduate student based at a U.S. institution you may apply to take part in research cruises aboard UNOLS vessels. To hear about opportunities you need to sign up to their mailing list. More details are available [here](https://www.unols.org/unols-cruise-opportunity-program).


## UNOLS Chief Scientist training

UNOLS occasionally run a cruise specifically designed to train chief scientists. It is open to students and early career researchers. More details [here](https://www.unols.org/nsf-unols-chief-scientist-training-cruise).


## The GO-SHIP program

Try signing up to the [GO-SHIP mailing list](http://www.go-ship.org/Join.html). This program conducts repeat hydrographic sections all over the world. They often need volunteers.

Also note that if you successfully receive a [GO-SHIP postdoctoral fellowship](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/postdoctoral-fellowships/), you will have the opportunity to be co-chief scientist aboard a GO-SHIP cruise.
