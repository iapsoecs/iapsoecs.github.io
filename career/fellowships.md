There are hundreds of fellowship opportunities around the world available to researchers of all career stages and we can't hope to list them all. Below we detail some of the more well known examples that might be of interested to early career oceanographers. Each fellowship has slightly different eligibility requirements and so we mention only the most fundamental ones such as nationality and experience level. Much more information can be found on the linked websites. If you think we've missed an opportunity that should be included here, please contact us and we will try to include it.
