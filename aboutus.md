## Objectives

* **Promote diversity, equity and inclusion**
    - Promote diversity as actively as possible and create awareness of the associated gaps/challenges and discrimination that currently exist within the scientific community.

* **Connect with organisations**
    - Maximise the impact and connectivity of the IAPSO Early Career Network by liasing with other national and international networks.

* **Liaise with the Executive committee**
    - Provide advice from the Early Career Network to the IAPSO Executive Committee and communicate key agenda from the IAPSO directive back to the IAPSO Early Career Scientist Network.

* **Organise events**
    - Organise early career events at biannual IAPSO assemblies that may include mentoring, outreach activities and networking between early career scientists and senior researchers.

	<p><strong>Alejandra Sanchez-Franks (UK, chairperson):</strong>
	Alejandra is a research scientist in the Marine Physics and Ocean Climate Group at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in Southampton. She joined NOC after finishing her PhD in Stony Brook University, New York in April 2015 to work on the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE) project, which is a joint collaboration between the UK and India investigating the role of the Bay of Bengal in monsoon variability. As of January 2019, she has joined the RAPID-AMOC (project monitoring the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation) team.</p>
