## Objectives

* To provide advice from the Early Career Network to the IAPSO Executive Committee and to communicate key agenda from the IAPSO directive back to the IAPSO Early Career Scientist Network.
* To maximise impact and connectivity of the IAPSO Early Career Network by liasing with other national and international networks.
* To organise early career events at biannual IAPSO assemblies that may include mentoring, outreach activities and maximising networking between early career scientists and senior researchers. 
* To promote diversity as actively as possible and to create awareness of the associated gaps/challenges and discrimination that currently exist withing the scientific community.

	<p><strong>Alejandra Sanchez-Franks (UK, chairperson):</strong> 
	Alejandra is a research scientist in the Marine Physics and Ocean Climate Group at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in Southampton. She joined NOC after finishing her PhD in Stony Brook University, New York in April 2015 to work on the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE) project, which is a joint collaboration between the UK and India investigating the role of the Bay of Bengal in monsoon variability. As of January 2019, she has joined the RAPID-AMOC (project monitoring the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation) team.</p>

	<p><strong>Danielle Su (France, member):</strong> 
	Danielle started her journey as an oceanographer moving from one island (Singapore) to another (Australia) and recently completed her PhD at The University of Western Australia investigating flow topography interactions around islands in the Northern Indian Ocean. Now at the LOCEAN Laboratory in Paris, she is delving into the world of biogeochemistry. Enjoys hiking and good wine, especially if done together.</p>
