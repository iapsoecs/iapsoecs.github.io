## Objectives

* To provide advice from the Early Career Network to the IAPSO Executive Committee and to communicate key agenda from the IAPSO directive back to the IAPSO Early Career Scientist Network.
* To maximise impact and connectivity of the IAPSO Early Career Network by liasing with other national and international networks.
* To organise early career events at biannual IAPSO assemblies that may include mentoring, outreach activities and maximising networking between early career scientists and senior researchers. 
* To promote diversity as actively as possible and to create awareness of the associated gaps/challenges and discrimination that currently exist withing the scientific community.
