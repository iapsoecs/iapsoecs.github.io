The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) Early Career Network is open to anyone that self identifies as an early career scientist in physical or chemical scinces of the oceans.

We envision a community that will provide networking opportunities, mentoring, conference activities and easy access to information about jobs, field work opportunities, workshops and more. Whilst doing this we will strive to promote diversity and inclusivity as actively as possible.
