The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans ([IAPSO](http://iapso.iugg.org/)) Early Career Scientists network is open to anyone  that self identifies as an early career scientist in physical or chemical sciences of the oceans. [Join here.]({% link joinus.md %})

We envision a community that will provide networking opportunities, mentoring, conference activities and easy access to information about [jobs]({% link jobs/index.html %}), [field work opportunities]({% link career/cruises.md %}), workshops and more. Whilst doing this we will strive to promote diversity and inclusivity as actively as possible. Most recent updates from the IAPSO ECS network are published in our [newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).

## Important Updates

### We are recruiting a new committee member

We are looking for a 10th member to join the IAPSO ECS committee! In particular, we are looking for someone who will spearhead a new sub-committee on equity, diversity and inclusion. As an IAPSO ECS committee member you may also be responsible for tasks such as assisting with social media, organising events at the IAPSO assemblies, participating in quarterly meetings, etc.

If you are interested in joining our team, please send an [email](mailto:iapsoecs@gmail.com) detailing how you would like to contribute to the team and a one page CV.

As our group currently has representation from North America, Europe and Asia, we particularly encourage applications from representatives affiliated with universities/institutes in Africa and South/Central America.

### Call for Ocean Decade U.S. participation

The ocean is central to the functioning of the planet and human well-being, but ongoing depletion, warming, and pollution threaten its future. The [UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development](https://www.oceandecade.org) is a global effort from 2021-2030 focused on ensuring the sustainable use of ocean resources and long-term ocean health. The U.S. National Committee for the [Ocean Decade U.S.](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/us-national-committee-on-ocean-science-for-sustainable-development-2021-2030) invites top experts in a wide range of disciplines to join this important effort. Learn how to participate [here](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/us-national-committee-on-ocean-science-for-sustainable-development-2021-2030).

This award honours Early Career Scientists for their outstanding research in the physical or chemical sciences of the oceans, and for their cooperation in international research. The IAPSO Early Career Scientist Medals, one for physical ocean science and one for chemical ocean science are presented by the IAPSO President, every two years, at the biannual IAPSO Assembly, where the Awardees are expected to give a talk on a scientific topic of their choice. The next assemly is likely to be held virtually (see below).

Please find the procedure and requirements for nomination on the [IAPSO website](http://iapso.iugg.org/awards-and-honors/early-career-scientist-medal.html).
