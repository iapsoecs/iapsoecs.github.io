The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans ([IAPSO](http://iapso.iugg.org/)) Early Career Scientists network is open to anyone  that self identifies as an early career scientist in physical or chemical sciences of the oceans. [Join here.]({% link joinus.md %})

We envision a community that will provide networking opportunities, mentoring, conference activities and easy access to information about [jobs]({% link jobs/index.html %}), [field work opportunities]({% link career/cruises.md %}), workshops and more. Whilst doing this we will strive to promote diversity and inclusivity as actively as possible. Most recent updates from the IAPSO ECS network are published in our [newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).

## Important Updates

### Metrology workshop opportunity

We would like to inform you of this early career opportunity from MINKE, which is a European Commission funded project dedicated to metrology in the marine environment (https://minke.eu/services/sykeworkshop/).

The workshop will be held from 15 to 17 November 2022 in Helsinki, Finland, as a hybrid event permitting either remote (virtual) or on-site participation, with the possibility of a shift to a fully online event in the case of a national/global COVID-19 emergency.

A limited amount of funding is available for supporting in-person attendance, and participants wishing to avail of this possibility should fill in the application form at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OCz4om00SxJPz0MG4iEoumSLy1BaSNE4/edit and send it to the organizing committee (email to teemu.naykki@syke.fi) by the 13th of October. Information for remote participation will follow later, as well as a more detailed program.

### Joint ECS efforts are critical to furthering our understanding of the oceans
Early career scientist networks are rapidly growing, help you to contribute to the community, and help to further our understanding of the ocean. Check out this [new EGU blog post](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/os/2021/06/25/ocean-networks-1/) by IAPSO ECS committee member [Arvind Singh]({% link aboutus.md %}) to read more about the importances of ECS networks in our community.
