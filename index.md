The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans ([IAPSO](https://iapso-ocean.org/)) Early Career Scientists network is open to anyone  that self identifies as an early career scientist in physical or chemical sciences of the oceans. [Join here.]({% link joinus.md %})

We are a community that provides networking opportunities, mentoring, conference activities and easy access to information about [jobs]({% link jobs/index.html %}), [field work opportunities]({% link career/cruises.md %}), workshops and more. We actively develop and promote initiatives that increase diversity and inclusivity within the ocean sciences. Recent updates from the IAPSO ECS network are published in our [newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).

## Important Updates

### European Marine Board

The [European Marine Board](https://www.marineboard.eu/), with its Young Ambassadors, would like to promote and facilitate the work and career of early-career scientists working in EMB organizations. The [EMB ECOP Network](https://www.marineboard.eu/about-emb-ecop-network) aims at connecting Early Careers across Europe and proposes training and opportunity to link ocean science and policies at national and European levels. If you wish to be part of this initiative and be included in their communication loops, please fill this form: [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWhpKrAbsxTu4_EeiA1LR128bXasOuwhrIkQZV4k4yilW-8w/viewform?pli=1). 
The network is open to all self-identified Early Careers affiliated to one of the members of the European Marine Board (list [here](https://www.marineboard.eu/members)). You will be added to the mailing list and receive updates about EMB activities dedicated to Early careers (webinars, workshops, conferences, etc).

In addition, In February 2024, EMB will be opening a new call for applications to the EMB Young Ambassador programme (to be circulated soon). You may want to contact Alexandra Hahn (RD3), currently a EMB Young Ambassador, and Rebecca Zitoun (RD4), past EMB Young Ambassador (2021-2023) if you have any questions.

### IUGG Berlin 2023 General Assembly (11-20 July)
The IUGG 2023 General Assembly took place last summer in Berlin. Three events for Early Career Scientists were organized, including a first IUGG-wide event.

### Manifesto for Early Career Researchers
The Initiative for Science in Europe (ISE) published a [manifesto for Early Career Researchers](https://initiative-se.eu/manifesto/) to call for broad and robust support to early career investigators and scholars in times of uncertainty.

### Joint ECS efforts are critical to furthering our understanding of the oceans
Early career scientist networks are rapidly growing, help you to contribute to the community, and help to further our understanding of the ocean. Check out this [new EGU blog post](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/os/2021/06/25/ocean-networks-1/) by IAPSO ECS committee member [Arvind Singh]({% link aboutus.md %}) to read more about the importances of ECS networks in our community.
