The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans ([IAPSO](http://iapso.iugg.org/)) Early Career Scientists network is open to anyone  that self identifies as an early career scientist in physical or chemical sciences of the oceans. [Join here.]({% link joinus.md %})

We envision a community that will provide networking opportunities, mentoring, conference activities and easy access to information about [jobs]({% link jobs/index.html %}), [field work opportunities]({% link career/cruises.md %}), workshops and more. Whilst doing this we will strive to promote diversity and inclusivity as actively as possible. Most recent updates from the IAPSO ECS network are published in our [newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).

## Important Updates

### AWI is looking for a participant on a cruise across the ACC (physical oceanographer)

AWI is looking for a physical oceanographer (e.g. a PhD Student or Postdoc) who might be interested to go on a Southern Ocean cruise on a relatively short notice (starting October 1st). If you are interested please see [here]({% link career/cruises.md %}) for details.

Info: The The NERC CLASS programme (Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science) is running a seminar by Penny Holliday aimed at UK based ECRs in oceanography:

> In this short presentation I will give a little bit of background about CLASS and what NERC National Capability is, but mainly I will describe the ways in which ECRs from across the UK can make use of the CLASS cruises and research centres to design your own career development opportunity. Iâ€™ll provide some examples of the things that people have done already, with the view of inspiring you to think about how you could benefit.


### Joint ECS efforts are critical to furthering our understanding of the oceans
Early career scientist networks are rapidly growing, help you to contribute to the community, and help to further our understanding of the ocean. Check out this [new EGU blog post](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/os/2021/06/25/ocean-networks-1/) by IAPSO ECS committee member [Arvind Singh]({% link aboutus.md %}) to read more about the importances of ECS networks in our community.
