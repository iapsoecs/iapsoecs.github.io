The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans ([IAPSO](http://iapso.iugg.org/)) Early Career Scientists network is open to anyone  that self identifies as an early career scientist in physical or chemical sciences of the oceans. [Join here.]({% link joinus.md %})

We envision a community that will provide networking opportunities, mentoring, conference activities and easy access to information about [jobs]({% link jobs/index.html %}), [field work opportunities]({% link career/cruises.md %}), workshops and more. Whilst doing this we will strive to promote diversity and inclusivity as actively as possible. Most recent updates from the IAPSO ECS network are published in our [newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).

### Call for Ocean Decade U.S. participation

The ocean is central to the functioning of the planet and human well-being, but ongoing depletion, warming, and pollution threaten its future. The [UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development](https://www.oceandecade.org) is a global effort from 2021-2030 focused on ensuring the sustainable use of ocean resources and long-term ocean health. The U.S. National Committee for the [Ocean Decade U.S.](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/us-national-committee-on-ocean-science-for-sustainable-development-2021-2030) invites top experts in a wide range of disciplines to join this important effort. Learn how to participate [here](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/us-national-committee-on-ocean-science-for-sustainable-development-2021-2030).
