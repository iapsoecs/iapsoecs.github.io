The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans ([IAPSO](http://iapso.iugg.org/)) Early Career Scientists network is open to anyone  that self identifies as an early career scientist in physical or chemical sciences of the oceans. [Join here.]({% link joinus.md %})

We envision a community that will provide networking opportunities, mentoring, conference activities and easy access to information about [jobs]({% link jobs/index.html %}), [field work opportunities]({% link career/cruises.md %}), workshops and more. Whilst doing this we will strive to promote diversity and inclusivity as actively as possible. Most recent updates from the IAPSO ECS network are published in our [newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).

## Important Updates


### Students and Co-Chief Scientist opportunities to sail on the US GO-SHIP A13.5

US GO-SHIP will conduct a repeat hydrography section in the Atlantic Ocean, between December 2021 - March 2022 (dates to be finalized) on the GO-SHIP decadal re-occupation of the hydrographic section A13.5. (This 2021-2022 cruise is actually a re-occupation following a truncated A13.5 in 2020, due to COVID-19.)

US GO-SHIP is looking for early career scientists (high-level scientists/technicians, with PhDs or equivalent experience) with experience in physical or chemical oceanography (hydrography) who would be interested in participating on this cruise.

They are also seeking 2 students for CTD/deck operations (typically PO background), 1 student to assist with chlorofluorocarbon and SF6 (CFC) analysis (typically chemistry background), and 1 student to assist with LADCP (Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) operations.

[Please see announcement for details](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/2021/05/12/sail-on-a135/)

Deadline for applications: May 31, 2021.

### Call for Ocean Decade U.S. participation

The ocean is central to the functioning of the planet and human well-being, but ongoing depletion, warming, and pollution threaten its future. The [UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development](https://www.oceandecade.org) is a global effort from 2021-2030 focused on ensuring the sustainable use of ocean resources and long-term ocean health. The U.S. National Committee for the [Ocean Decade U.S.](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/us-national-committee-on-ocean-science-for-sustainable-development-2021-2030) invites top experts in a wide range of disciplines to join this important effort. Learn how to participate [here](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/us-national-committee-on-ocean-science-for-sustainable-development-2021-2030).



### Busan IAMAS-IACS-IAPSO [Joint Assembly 2021](http://www.baco-21.org/2021/english/main/index_en.asp)

Due to the global Coronavirus pandemic, the Joint Assembly will not happen in person and will likely reduce to a modest number of online keynote talks. The next Assembly will be IUGG 2023, in Berlin, Germany.
