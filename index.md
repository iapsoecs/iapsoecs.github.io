The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans ([IAPSO](https://iapso-ocean.org/)) Early Career Scientists network is open to anyone  that self identifies as an early career scientist in physical or chemical sciences of the oceans. [Join here.]({% link joinus.md %})

We envision a community that will provide networking opportunities, mentoring, conference activities and easy access to information about [jobs]({% link jobs/index.html %}), [field work opportunities]({% link career/cruises.md %}), workshops and more. Whilst doing this we will strive to promote diversity and inclusivity as actively as possible. Most recent updates from the IAPSO ECS network are published in our [newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).
