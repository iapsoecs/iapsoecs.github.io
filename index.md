The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans ([IAPSO](https://iapso-ocean.org/)) Early Career Scientists network is open to anyone  that self identifies as an early career scientist in physical or chemical sciences of the oceans. [Join here.]({% link joinus.md %})

We are a community that provides networking opportunities, mentoring, conference activities and easy access to information about [jobs]({% link jobs/index.html %}), [field work opportunities]({% link career/cruises.md %}), workshops and more. We actively develop and promote initiatives that increase diversity and inclusivity within the ocean sciences. Recent updates from the IAPSO ECS network are published in our [newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).

### Joint ECS efforts are critical to furthering our understanding of the oceans
Early career scientist networks are rapidly growing, help you to contribute to the community, and help to further our understanding of the ocean. Check out this [new EGU blog post](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/os/2021/06/25/ocean-networks-1/) by IAPSO ECS committee member [Arvind Singh]({% link aboutus.md %}) to read more about the importances of ECS networks in our community.
