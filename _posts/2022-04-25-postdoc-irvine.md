The Coastal Dynamics Laboratory at the University of California, Irvine invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher in coastal physical oceanography as part of an Office of Naval Research(ONR) funded study of the dynamics of refraction and reflection of nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs). The postdoc will use numerical modeling along with existing observational data to examine the dynamics of NLIW interactions with steep topography. The successful candidate will work directly with Dr. Kristen Davis at UC Irvine and a team of collaborators from Stanford University (Dr. Oliver Fringer,  Dr. Justin Rogers) and UC San Diego ( Dr. Geno Pawlak).   Ideally, the candidate will have a working knowledge of physical oceanography (specifically internal wave dynamics) and ocean modeling, although candidates with similar skills will be considered.
