The PhD study will address the transformation of Atlantic Water in the Norwegian Sea and Fram Strait, where the warm and saline waters flow poleward and partly recirculate in a complex current system under varying physical controls and processes.

The successful candidate will investigate processes on scales from mesoscale eddies to small-scale turbulence and mixing. This includes instabilities of boundary currents, exchanges and subduction across fronts, responses to atmospheric and tidal forcing, and internal waves. The research will be based on observations from ship surveys, underwater gliders, and bottom-anchored moored instruments.
