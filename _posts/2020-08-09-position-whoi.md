Job Summary

Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is currently searching for a Research Associate to join the Marine Chemistry & Geochemistry Department. This is a regular, full-time, exempt position, and is eligible for benefits.



A Biogeochemical scientist/data analyst is sought to contribute to projects studying ocean biogeochemistry using sensor-based ocean observing systems. A central role for the Research Associate will be to contribute to the Biogeochemical Argo (https://biogeochemical-argo.org<https://biogeochemical-argo.org/>) activities at WHOI, as part of the larger WHOI Argo effort (https://www2.whoi.edu/site/argo/).



The internal working title for this position could be either Research Associate I, Research Associate II, or Research Associate III. The final level of the position will be determined commensurate with the selected candidate's level of education & experience.

Essential Functions

The successful candidate will join a team pioneering advancements in ocean observations and the development of innovative data products. Responsibilities will include management and quality control of biogeochemical data collected by autonomous oceanographic platforms including Argo floats. Additional tasks will include sensor testing and evaluation, assisting with float pre-deployment checkout, coordinating cruise opportunities, and organizing and archiving cruise validation datasets. The successful candidate must be able to work well in a team, and with national and international partners including contributing to co-authored manuscripts for peer review and reports for internal and external audiences.
