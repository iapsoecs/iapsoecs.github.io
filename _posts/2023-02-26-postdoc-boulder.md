The Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado, Boulder is seeking
a Postdoctoral Research Associate to work in the Climate Process Team (CPT) on
Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy, which is a high profile collaboration involving multiple
institutions including New York University, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
Princeton, the University of Chicago, the National Center for Atmospheric Research,
NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab, Columbia University, and Brown University among
others. The role of the CU postdoc will be to develop and implement new subgrid-scale
parameterizations and to assess the accuracy of existing parameterizations in the ocean
component (MOM6) of CESM3 at non-eddying and eddy-permitting resolutions. The CU
postdoc will be directly advised by Ian Grooms (https://www.colorado.edu/amath/grooms) at CU, and will work closely with members
of NCAR's Ocean Section, as well as with the entire CPT. The research will include
mathematical modeling, diagnostic analysis of simulation results, and running CESM3 simulations.
Information about the broader project and related positions can be found at
https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/.

Minimum requirements include a Ph.D. in earth sciences, climate modeling, fluid dynamics,
applied mathematics, computational science, physics, or a closely related field.
For full consideration please apply by March 15, 2023. Applications must be submitted
through https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/?jobId=45509.
