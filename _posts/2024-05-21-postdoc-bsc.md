We would like to inform you about a new job opportunity offered by Barcelona Supercomputing Center:

The Earth Sciences Department of Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-ES) led by Prof Francisco Doblas-Reyes develops, among other research tools, global climate models to perform a range of climate experiments at frontier (storm and eddy-resolving) spatial resolutions. The Department is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to assist in the development and analysis of the high-resolution global simulations with the IFS/NEMO climate model.

The position offered is funded by the European projects EERIE and EXPECT, and involves (1) providing scientific feedback to improve the physical soundness of a Digital Twin based on IFS-NEMO developed at the BSC within the Destination Earth initiative, (2) leading the production of cutting edge simulations with an eddy-resolving version of IFS-NEMO, and (3) contributing to their scientific analysis with a specific focus on the impact of ocean eddies on the local air-sea interactions, their influence on the atmospheric circulation and their ultimate impact on extreme events.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please apply through this link: https://www.bsc.es/join-us/job-opportunities/55523escvcr2

The vacancy will remain open until 16th of June 2024.
