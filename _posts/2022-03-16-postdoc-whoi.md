We are inviting applications for a Postdoctoral Investigator in coupled air-sea-wave modeling and
parameterizations for the North Atlantic Ocean. The successful candidate will work on projects to
improve the representation of the impacts of ocean and surface waves in the ocean mixed layer,
atmospheric boundary layer, and air-sea fluxes. The projects will be using the SCOAR regional coupled
modeling system (WRF-ROMS-WW3, https://hseo.whoi.edu/scoar-model) and will test a hierarchical representation
of the ocean and wave-mediated processes in NASAâ€™s Unified WRF (https://nuwrf.gsfc.nasa.gov).

The candidate should have strong numerical modeling and quantitative skills with prior experience
with wave models (WW3). Since the coupled effects of waves on the ocean and atmosphere are a salient
aspect of the projects, any other experience with ROMS, WRF, or other regional coupled modeling systems
(including COAWST) is a plus. We are also interested in candidates with expertise in analyzing in situ
and remotely-sensed observations for surface waves, near-surface turbulent mixing, and air-sea fluxes.
 
The initial appointment will be for 1 year with a possible second-year continuation contingent on
progress and funding. Qualified applicants must apply anline. The documents should include a cover letter,
CV, and contact information (only) of 3 references. Review of applications will begin April 1, 2022, and
continue until the position is filled. Interested applicants should contact Dr. Hyodae Seo (hseo@whoi.edu).
