Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is currently searching for a Research Assistant to join the Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department. This is a regular, full-time, non-exempt position, and is eligible for benefits.

We are seeking a Research Assistant to assist with fabrication, demonstration, and validation of an autonomous, low power, field deployable underwater Eddy Covariance H+ ion and Oxygen Exchange System (ECHOES) capable of long-term resolution of benthic fluxes of carbon and oxygen. These measurements pertain to several ongoing research projects in the MACHINE Lab (https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/mlong/) focused on engineering solutions, advanced instrumentation, and technology development to study biogeochemical cycling, physical transport processes, and bio-physical interactions in coastal marine environments. There will be opportunities for at-sea research on coastal research vessels and hands-on deployments of instrumentation at shallow coastal sites such as seagrass meadows or coral reefs.

While some degree of experience with mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, coding, sensing technology, biogeochemistry, or fluid dynamics is desirable, it is not expected that the applicant will necessarily have hands-on experience with more than a few of these topics. The MACHINE Lab has a strong interdisciplinary focus, and a successful applicant will have some experience in any of the topics above, with a desire to learn from and engage with other lab members on this interdisciplinary research team.

The internal working title for this position could be either Research Assistant II, or Research Assistant III. The final level of the position will be determined commensurate with the selected candidate's level of education & experience.  This position is renewable annually depending on performance and funding availability. On-line application forms should be submitted, along with a detailed cover letter that outlines your prior experience as it pertains to this position and full curriculum vitae including contact information for three references. The position is available beginning September 1, 2022. Please state your availability in the cover letter.

ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS

With some supervision, this person will serve as the lab manager responsible for day-to-day oversight and coordination, in addition to participating in a number of ongoing research programs. This person will also provide technical assistance on the development and deployment of a long-term eddy covariance system. Duties will include:

  *   General laboratory coordination including safety related issues, oversight, and training, ordering supplies, maintaining equipment and laboratory organization;
  *   May be responsible for the testing, calibration, and troubleshooting of field and scientific equipment, and for the planning and preparation for research cruises;
  *   Assist with the fabrication or engineering of the field measurement system;
  *   Deployment and site visits in a small boat with opportunities for snorkeling/diving;
  *   Contribute to data analysis and data management for research related tasks.


NON-ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS:

  *   As deemed necessary by supervisor
Education & Experience
A Bachelor's degree in Chemistry, Physics, Marine Science, Ocean Engineering or a related field is required.
Any of the following background experience is particularly desirable:

  *   Experience coding (e.g., C++, Matlab, Python, etc.)
  *   Working with microcontrollers and other electronic components
  *   Experience with mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, 3D printing, or CAD
  *   Coastal biogeochemistry
  *   Instrumentation for turbulence, oxygen, pH or other oceanographic measurements
  *   Some level of interdisciplinary marine research experience and/or a desire to learn new interdisciplinary skills
