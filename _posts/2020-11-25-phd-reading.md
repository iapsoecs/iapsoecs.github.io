**Toward next generation sea ice models: taking the rough with the smooth?**

Supervisors: Prof. Danny Feltham, Dr. David Schroeder, Department of Meteorology, University of Reading; Dr. Ed Blockley, Met Office

Sea ice, formed from the freezing of ocean water, covers a large fraction of the polar oceans and plays a central role in the climate system, moderating air-ocean transfers of heat, moisture and momentum, and moderating global patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation. The unprecedentedly rapid decline of Arctic sea ice in the last two decades is a conspicuous indicator of climate change. The state of the sea ice cover is also important for Arctic navigation, wildlife, and indigenous communities.

With advances in computing, climate models are being run at increasingly fine spatial resolutions, in order, for example, to accurately resolve motions of the ocean and atmosphere and their associated heat transports. However, the sea ice components of these climate models were never designed for such resolutions. This project will address fundamental uncertainty in the structure of existing sea ice models and contribute to the future direction of sea ice modelling and model development, particularly in the Met Office and across Europe.

The conclusions from this study have potentially wide-ranging implications for climate and weather modelling of the polar regions.

The project has CASE funding from The Met Office.

Applicants should hold or expect to gain a minimum of a 2:1 Bachelor Degree, Masters Degree with Merit, or equivalent in (ideally) physics, applied mathematics, engineering, or a similar numerate subject such as meteorology, along with an aptitude and enthusiasm for applying physical principles to solve real world problems and computer programming.
