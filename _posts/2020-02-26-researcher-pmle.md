As a Research Physical Scientist, you will perform the following duties:

	• Plan, organize, and execute systematic research in the complex interactions between the world’s oceans, atmosphere and sea floor, and how such interactions affect chemical, biological and physical processes. Use a variety of instruments and observation platforms.   A specific area of focus will be the Biogeochemical Argo program, which will contribute to understanding of ocean carbon uptake, pH changes, oxygen changes and the nitrate cycle, the biological carbon pump, and composition of phytoplankton communities.
	
	• Lead in the collection, calibration and quality control of data from oceanographic field research. Formulate, propose and manage oceanographic field research.
	
	• Perform scientific research to measure and predict marine biogeochemical and/or ecological responses to variations in physical, chemical, or biological oceanographic parameters.
	
	• Write and present scientific papers on interdisciplinary research for publication in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Present research results at national and international meetings and scientific planning activities.
