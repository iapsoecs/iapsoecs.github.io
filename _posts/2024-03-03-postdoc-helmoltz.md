Work location: Geesthacht, close to Hamburg

Application deadline: March 10th, 2024

The Coastal Climate and Regional Sea Level Changes group of the Institute
of Coastal Systems at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon in Geesthacht, near
Hamburg, Germany, invites applications for an exciting two-year postdoc
position. It will be in the field of storylines and climate change
attribution of extreme events as part of the BMBF project ‘WAKOS-2’
starting March 1st, 2024, and ending February 28th, 2026. Within the
project ‘Water on the coasts of East Frisia: Tailored Climate Services for
Adaptation (WAKOS-2)’, a number of German Universities and authorities will
work on appropriate adaptation measures to create a climate-resilient East
Frisia region. Processes such as the expected rise in mean sea level, storm
surges, heavy rain events or periods of drought play an important role as
they cause coastal erosion, groundwater recharge or saltwater intrusion and
thereby influence coastal protection.

Equal opportunity is an important part of our personnel policy. We would
therefore strongly encourage qualified women to apply for the position. In
principle, the full time position (39 h/week) is also sharable.

Your tasks

The sub-project of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon will focus on event-based
storylines for a number of extreme events over Northern Germany and the
German Bight and their attribution to anthropogenic climate warming.
Regional spectrally nudged storyline simulations will be performed for
present, preindustrial, and future climate states. The method was
successfully implemented on a global scale for heat waves and droughts.
These simulations will be downscaled to higher resolution using a regional
climate model and will now be extended to cold winters, extratropical
storms and storm surges. The overall goal is to achieve a quantification of
climate change impacts for these extreme events.

Your profile

•          PhD (or be about to complete) in meteorology/atmospheric physics or in a related scientific field (e.g., geophysics or earth system science)
•          strong interest in extreme events, climate change detection and attribution, climate modelling, and atmospheric dynamics
•          experience in a higher programming language
•          ability to communicate effectively in spoken and written English
•          good knowledge of data analysis/statistics
•          strong motivation, also to publish in peer-reviewed journals and to present scientific results at international conferences

We offer you

•          an exciting and varied job in a research centre with more than 1,000 employees from around 60 nations
•          a well connected research campus and best networking opportunities
•          individual opportunities for further training
•          social benefits according to the collective agreement of the public service and remuneration
•          an excellent technical infrastructure and modern workplace equipment
•          6 weeks holiday per year; company holidays between Christmas and New Year's Day
•          very good compatibility of private and professional life through offers of mobile and flexible work
•          family-friendly company policy with childcare facilities, e. g.nursery close to the company
•          free assistance program for employees (EAP)
•          Corporate Benefits
•          a varied offer in the canteen on campus

Severely disabled persons and those equaling severely disabled persons who
are equally suitable for the position will be considered preferentially
within the framework of legal requirements.
