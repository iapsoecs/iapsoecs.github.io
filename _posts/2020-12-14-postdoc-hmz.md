**Full description of position**

Research Scientist (m/f/d) in the area of submesoscale dynamics

Reference code: 50047891_2 â€“ 2020/KO 10
Commencement date: April 1st, 2021
The place of employment is Geesthacht.

The department of Submesoscale Dynamics investigates the dynamics of
submesoscale eddies, filaments and fronts in coastal and shelf regions. One
focus is on their interaction with the biogeochemistry and productivity -
and how these effects upscale globally. This is achieved with a combination
of high-resolution observations and models for specific regional settings.
Current projects include coastal and shelf regions off Cape Verde, Norway,
and the South Atlantic.

We are looking for a qualified and motivated scientist to identify key
processes, propose their adequate sampling as well as help to implement and
evaluate high-resolution, physical-biogeochemical model simulations in
coastal and shelf regions.

We invite applications for a Research Scientist position (m/f/d) in the
research group Submesoscale Dynamics at the Institute of Coastal Research.
The position is initially limited to three years.
Your tasks

   - scientific analysis of high-resolution observations and models of
   submesoscale processes with special emphasis on horizontal and vertical
   mixing processes, and their impact on physical-biological interactions
   - design and implementation of coastal and shelf model simulations (e.g.
   ROMS)
   - implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms into
   large/multi-disciplinary datasets
   - data assimilation of biogeochemical variables into earth system models
   - implementation and testing of parameterisations in coarse-resolution
   ocean circulation models
   - planning of and participation in international research expeditions
   - scientific publications and presentations
   - working as an integral part of a motivated multidisciplinary team
   within the institute and with external academic partners

Your profile

Essential qualifications:

   - a doctoral degree in physical oceanography, engineering, or related
   discipline
   - at least 2 years of post-doctoral experience
   - research experience on physical-biological interactions at meso- and
   submesoscales
   - excellent academic publication record
   - knowledge of processing and interpretation of observations and model
   output
   - good communication skills in English
   - high degree of creativity and flexibility

Desirable qualifications:

   - knowledge of Linux/Unix operating systems
   - familiarity with regional numerical models and high-performance
   computing platforms
   - experience with multi-disciplinary and high-resolution in situ or
   remote sensing observations
   - good programming skills in Matlab, Python, R or Julia
   - knowledge of handling NetCDF and GRIB data sets
   - willingness to participate in research cruises and travel
   - desire to acquire solid communication skills in German

We offer you

   - multinational work environment with over 1,000 colleagues from more
   than 50 nations
   - extensive options of vocational training (i. a. expert seminars,
   language courses or leadership seminars)
   - flexible working hours and various models to ensure the compatibility
   of family and career
   - excellent infrastructure, including a scientific in-house library as
   well as modern work spaces
   - remuneration according to the standards of the collective wage
   agreement TV-AVH including further social benefits

The promotion of equal rights is a matter of course for us. Severely
disabled persons and those equaling severely disabled persons who are
equally suitable for the position will be considered preferentially within
the framework of legal requirements.
