The Postdoctoral Fellow will work on the development and evaluation of parameterisations for internal tides in the MOM6 ocean model. The role will include running and analysing high-resolution ocean model simulations to examine the influence of tides on ocean heat uptake, heat transport across the Antarctic shelf, and other key processes relevant to the climate system. The Postdoctoral Fellow will work with an investigatory team including Prof. Andy Hogg, Dr Adele Morrison, Dr Callum Shakespeare and Prof. Brian Arbic, and will be supported by a Software Engineer. This position is based in the Climate and Fluid Physics group at the Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University. 

Applications close 30th April
