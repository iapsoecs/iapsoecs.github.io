POSTDOC POSITION IN OCEAN PROCESS MODELING AND THEORY

 

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral researcher in ocean process modeling and theory to work with Prof. Leif Thomas in the Department of Earth System Science at Stanford University. A strong background in fluid dynamics with application to the ocean or atmosphere and expertise in numerical modeling is required. 

 

The successful candidate will pursue research to study the seasonal cycle of submesoscale turbulence in the subtropical gyres and/or the interaction of wind-driven inertial motions with eddies and fronts.  The main objective of the research is to improve our understanding of how submesoscale processes and wave-mean flow interactions transfer energy between mesoscale flows and small-scale turbulence and how this varies seasonally. The research is part of multi-institution collaborative projects, and will involve a combination of theory, numerical modeling, simulations to design observational field campaigns, and analysis of submesoscale-resolving observations.

 

Evaluation of applications will begin immediately and will continue until the position is filled. The start date is flexible (ideally between Fall 2021 and Spring 2022), but completion of the PhD is required. However, candidates who have held postdoctoral appointments for more than four years are not eligible. The initial appointment is for one year and renewable for up to one additional year, subject to satisfactory performance and funding availability. Salary is commensurate with experience and a full benefits package is available (https://postdocbenefits.stanford.edu/benefit-options). Stanford postdoctoral scholars are expected to be on campus regularly, therefore remote appointments will not be considered. Inquiries and applications should be sent by email to leift@stanford.edu. Applications should include a CV (with a list of publications), brief statement of research interests, experience, and future career plans, and the names and contact information of three or more references.


Stanford is an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
