There is a vacancy for a Postdoc position in climate dynamics at the Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen, Norway, and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research. The position is for a fixed-term period of 3 years and is associated with the project “Overturning circulation in the new Arctic (ArMOC)” funded by the Research Council of Norway. The project includes international partners from UK, USA, and Sweden.

The appointed postdoctoral researcher will investigate how present and future Arctic climate change impacts the Arctic overturning circulation. This will be achieved by:
- Quantifying changes in Atlantic Water modification along the Atlantic Water Boundary Current.
- Identifying changes in Atlantic Water pathways in present and future climates using Lagrangian simulations.
- Determining the effects of a changing climate on the Arctic overturning circulation.
