The Climate Dynamics section at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz
Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven, Germany, invites
applications for a PhD student position in the field of eddy-rich climate
modelling.

The successful candidate will work with some of the leading European
climate modellers and IT experts in the EU Horizon Europe project “European
Eddy-rich Earth System Models (EERIE)” on building, running and analysing a
new generation of Earth System Models that are capable of explicitly
representing a crucially important, yet unexplored regime of the Earth
system – the ocean mesoscale (~10 km at the equator to few km at high
latitudes).
