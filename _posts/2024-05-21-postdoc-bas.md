We are seeking a Physical Oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey.  This is a 2.5-year postdoc position that will examine ice-ocean interactions in front of and beneath Antarctic ice shelves. The overarching aim is to understand how ocean variability impacts the rate of ice shelf basal melting; and quantify the small-scale turbulent processes that are involved. The position comes with the opportunity to participate in a 2.5 month deep-field hot water drilling campaign on Thwaites Ice Shelf in West Antarctica (subject to medical clearance).

Potential candidates are very welcome to contact myself (petvis@bas.ac.uk) with any questions about the role.
