A 1-year position is currently open to start ASAP in University Grenoble
Alpes, France LEGI (Laboratory of Geophysical and Industrial Flows). The
incoming person will join on-going efforts to investigate experimentally
the properties of turbulence of internal gravity waves.

The goal is to investigate the relevance of the interpretation of
submesoscale turbulence in the ocean as wave turbulence of internal
gravity waves as described by the Garrett & Munk spectrum through
analytical experiments. The post-doc associate will run experiments in
the large scale Coriolis facility and analyse existing and new datasets.
Experience with PIV/PTV techniques and statistical analysis of turbulent
flows is important.
This research is funded by the Simons collaboration on wave turbulence.
