The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) invites applications for its Postdoctoral Fellows program for 2021-2022. UTIG, which is part of the Jackson School of Geosciences<http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/> at The University of Texas at Austin, is known for research excellence and international field programs in geophysics (solid earth, marine, polar), climate science, planetary science, and energy geoscience.
This is a highly competitive institutional award open to recent doctorates (degree within the past 3 years) in Earth, marine, and planetary science or allied fields.  The appointment is for two years. Recipients may pursue their own research interests in any scientific subfield that complements or expands ongoing UTIG programs, and are encouraged to identify and contact one or more prospective UTIG mentor(s).

Applications must contain: 1) a current Curriculum Vitae (CV) that includes education, employment history, publications, and record of any extramural funding; 2) a two page research proposal (including references or figures) stating research interests and specific plans for their UTIG residence and addressing how they complement or expand ongoing research directions at UTIG (ig.utexas.edu/research/<http://ig.utexas.edu/research/>); and 3) names and contact information for three individuals willing to write letters of reference.
