Earth system science and ocean biogeochemistry group in School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology jointly invite applications for a postdoctoral researcher position. The successful candidate will advance our understanding of ocean carbon sinks through the theoretical, computational, and observational analyses in collaboration with Drs. Amanda Timmerman, Chris Reinhard and Taka Ito. This position will be responsible to perform regional ocean physical and biogeochemical simulations, analyze output, and present findings in peer-review journal publications and national/international conferences. The scientific questions include the controls of natural and human-induced changes in ocean carbon uptake including ocean-based carbon dioxide removal approaches. The successful candidate will need working knowledge in ocean nutrient, alkalinity and carbon cycling and proficiency in programming skills.


DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

  *   Perform regional physical-biological simulations
  *   Advance the theoretical framework of ocean carbon uptake and its application to ocean-based carbon dioxide removal
  *   Publish research outcomes in peer-reviewed journals

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

  *   Doctoral degree in related field
  *   Programming skills (Fortran, python and/or MATLAB)
  *   Ability to collaborate effectively in a group
  *   Excellent written and oral communication skills

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS

  *   Proficiency in biogeochemical cycling, carbonate chemistry, and air-sea gas transfer
  *   Experience working in HPC environment
  *   Experience in data analysis with large oceanic/atmospheric environmental datasets
  *   Publications in related field
