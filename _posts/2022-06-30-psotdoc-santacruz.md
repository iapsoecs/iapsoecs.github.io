The Fisheries Collaborative Program (FCP) at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Marine Sciences, in
collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National
Marine Fisheries Service, seeks a Project Scientist or Specialist to work on climate and
oceanography of the North Pacific.

The candidate will work with global climate and earth system models, regional ocean models, and
observational datasets, and should have strong skills in accessing, downloading, analyzing, and
visualizing large data sets. The individual will participate in research projects to understand North
Pacific dynamics across timescales including historical analyses, short-term forecasts, and long-
term projections. Potential research areas include marine ecosystem predictability, ocean extreme
events, drivers of long-term change in global climate and regional ocean models, responses of the
coastal ocean to climate variability, and climate impacts on the chemistry and biology of the CCS
from phytoplankton to top predators. These efforts are part of broader interdisciplinary projects
aimed at developing improved fisheries management strategies for the California Current System.

The position will be based at the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Monterey,
California. The position will remain open until filled.

Applicants should apply through the links below. Note that these links are for open pools of
scientists, so the position descriptions are very broad. People whose interests and expertise match
the description above should apply. For questions, please contact Dr. Mike Jacox
(michael.jacox@noaa.gov).
