**Associate Scientist II**

Application Deadline: This position will be posted until November 6, 2020.

Term: This is a 2 year term position with the possibility of extension.

Relocation: Relocation assistance is available for this position. Working
from home/remotely (nationally or internationally) is expected in this
COVID-19 environment.

Work Authorization: UCAR/NCAR will sponsor a work visa to fill this
position. Due to COVID-19 and US Government policy, UCAR's sponsorship of a
work Visa does not guarantee a candidate's ability to enter/work in the U.S.



What You Will Do:


This position is under the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation
(JCSDA) and provides partial support for the Sea ice Ocean Coupled
Assimilation (SOCA) project.  The SOCA project is an inter-agency effort
aimed at developing marine Data Assimilation (DA) systems within the Joint
Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI).

The Associate Scientist contributes to the development of high-resolution
regional ocean data assimilation in the context of hurricane forecasting. A
special focus will be in the implementation of the MOM6 interface to JEDI to
the regional North Atlantic domain of the NOAA?s Hurricane Analysis Forecast
System (HAFS).

This position will be located at the NOAA-NCWCP building in College Park, MD
or in Boulder, CO.


Responsibilities:


*         Implement and test 3DVAR and Ensemble of DA for the North Atlantic Domain

*         Extract the atmospheric forcing from the HAFS 3 km resolution for the north atlantic basin

*         Streamline the grid generation process and generate regional grids relevant to the DA development and HAFS, starting with the north atlantic domain

*         Develop ocean mesoscale related diagnostic tools to assess the quality of the analysis

*         Development of software tools to extract boundary & initial conditions from the JEDI based global ? degree MOM6 DA system jointly developed by the JCSDA and EMC

*         Write and present scientific papers and documentation material in conferences, workshops, tutorials and educational events to the JCSDA partners and the scientific data assimilation community



What You Need:


Education and Years of Experience

*         Bachelor degree or equivalent in a related scientific discipline.

*         Two to three years' experience as an Associate Scientist I (or equivalent position) with evidence of professional progress as described above, or additional education (as in a program leading to a Master's degree). Experience or education must involve scientific research pertinent to the UCAR program.


Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities

*         Strong scientific background (physical oceanography, mathematics, physics or related field)

*         Good programming skills: software design, object-oriented programming and parallel programming

*         Knowledge of modern software engineering practices (source code management, continuous integration, issue tracking)

*         Good English language communication skills, ability to communicate with software engineers and scientists

*         Ability to work well within a diverse and multidisciplinary team


Desired:

*         Knowledge of data assimilation for ocean applications


Applicant Notes:


*         An Inclusion Statement will be required for all applicants advancing to an in-person interview. If requested, this statement should address past efforts, as well as future vision and plans to advocate for and advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the organization and/or field of work.
