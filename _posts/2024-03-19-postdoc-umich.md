We seek applicants for a postdoctoral position at the University of Michigan. The position is part
of the NASA project “Impact of changes in sea level and ocean stratification on tides and lunar
orbital parameters” and funding may be available for up to three years. The successful applicant
will run and analyze models of tides and tidal dissipation to ascertain changes over the last 30
years and will then compare these changes to changes inferred from satellite altimetry and lunar
laser ranging. Altimetry measures ocean tidal elevations and provides an estimate of the globally
integrated ocean tidal dissipation. Lunar laser ranging measures the Earth-Moon distance with
laser pulses that reflect off mirrors left on the Moon by Apollo astronauts. Tidal dissipation in
Earth’s oceans slows down Earth’s rotation rate and relatedly controls the rate at which the
Moon recedes from the Earth. Preliminary results suggest that the rate of lunar recession appears
to be changing in a manner consistent with what one would expect from the changes in tides
estimated from altimetry and ocean modeling. The latter in turn appear to be due to changes in
sea level and ocean stratification. The project will therefore quantify the effects of climate
change on Earth on the motions of another celestial body (the Moon).

This postdoctoral position offers the opportunity to collaborate with project scientists at the
University of Michigan, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA Goddard Space Flight
Center, and the University of Bonn. The project team includes world leaders in global ocean tide
and general circulation modeling, satellite altimetry, and solar system celestial dynamics. Two of
the NASA JPL scientists are on the solar system ephemeris team. The ephemeris (high-precision
positions of objects in the solar system) is a fundamental product that underlies solar system
exploration. This project offers an unparalleled opportunity to perform highly interdisciplinary
research.

The postdoc will be encouraged to travel to professional society meetings and collaborating
institutions to present project results and network with other scientists. Residence in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, is preferred, but remote residence near our collaborating institutions in Pasadena
(California), Bethesda (Maryland), or elsewhere will be considered especially for strong
applications.

The successful applicant should have a PhD in physical oceanography, physics, or a related field,
and strong skills in physics, math, and computing. Applicants should send a letter of interest,
curriculum vitae, including a list of publications and presentations, and contact information for
three references to Dr. Brian Arbic (arbic@umich.edu). Applications will be considered until the
position is filled, with a preferred start date in summer 2024.

The University of Michigan offers competitive salary and benefits packages for postdoctoral
scientists. My lab is committed to recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce and we
encourage all employees to incorporate their diverse backgrounds, skills, and life experiences
into their work. The University of Michigan is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.
