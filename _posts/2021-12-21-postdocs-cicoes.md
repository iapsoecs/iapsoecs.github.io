Now Accepting Applications for Postdoctoral Researchers

The Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) seeks at least three Postdoctoral Scholars with research interests in climate, oceanography, and/or ecosystem science including management and policy.

Postdocs may be located at any one of the three consortium member universities: University of Washington (https://cicoes.uw.edu/) (UW), Oregon State University (https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/cicoes) (OSU), and University of Alaska Fairbanks (https://cicoes-uaf.org/) (UAF). As a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) sponsored Cooperative Institute, CICOES promotes and facilitates collaborative research among partner universities and the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/alaska-fisheries-science-center) (AFSC), the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center) (NWFSC), and/or the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/) (PMEL).

Successful appointments are based on the applicant's research proposal. Applicants are expected to conduct research in at least one of CICOES' nine research themes (https://cicoes.uw.edu/research/): climate and ocean variability, change, and impacts; Earth systems and processes; environmental chemistry and ocean carbon; marine ecosystems; ocean and coastal observations; environmental data science, aquaculture science, human dimensions in marine systems, and polar studies.

Applicants are required to demonstrate research relevance to both CICOES and at least one of the NOAA programs at AFSC, NWFSC, or PMEL. In addition to their University mentor, the Postdoctoral Scholar will conduct research in association with at least one scientist directly associated with scientific programs at AFSC, NWFSC, and/or PMEL. A list of potential PI mentors can be found at these links: UW (https://cicoes.uw.edu/education/postdoc-program/postdoctoral-mentors/), UAF (https://cicoes-uaf.org/postdoctoral/postdoc-mentors/), and OSU (https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/cicoes-affiliated-faculty).

The impact of CICOES's environmental research is felt by communities all over the world, and a broad variety of perspectives and life experiences is essential to the success of this research. We encourage candidates from groups historically and currently underrepresented in these fields to apply. Please read our institutional commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion at UW, UAF, and OSU in the ad linked below.

Appointments have a 12-month service period, renewable for a second 12 months subject to approval and availability of funding. A competitive salary, a small research/travel budget, and a relocation stipend are included in the award.

Applications are due in Interfolio (https://apply.interfolio.com/99164) by January 23, 2022 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time.

For disability accommodations and/or questions about the position, please contact Collen Marquist, CICOES Executive Assistant, at marquist@uw.edu.
