One postdoctoral research position is available in the *Department of
Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of California, Los
Angeles*. The successful candidate will work in the broad area of *numerical
studies of ocean turbulence in coastal areas using large eddy simulations*.
The position is funded by an ARPA-E grant aimed at investigating *turbulence
and nutrient fluxes within kelp canopies (both in natural and farming
scenarios)* and the successful candidate will interact with a larger group
of collaborators focusing on other aspects of the problem (including field
measurements, biogeochemical modeling, etc.). Candidates must have a PhD
degree in atmospheric/oceanic sciences, engineering, applied math, or a
closely related field. Research experience in turbulence, numerical
modeling, large eddy simulation, and parallel computing is highly
desirable. The successful candidate will be co-advised by Profs.
Marcelo Chamecki and Jim McWilliams. The salary will be competitive and
commensurate with relevant experience. Applications from women and
underrepresented minorities are particularly encouraged, and U.S.
citizenship or residency is not required.

Interested applicants should send a CV with a cover letter, names of three
references, and a summary of recent work and research interests. All
applications should be submitted electronically as a single PDF
document to *Prof. Marcelo Chamecki (chamecki@ucla.edu)*. This
appointment is for one year and may be renewed pending satisfactory
performance and funding availability. The start date would preferably be
between January and March 2023, but this can also be negotiated. *Review of
applications will begin on Dec 1st*, and it will continue until the
position is filled.
