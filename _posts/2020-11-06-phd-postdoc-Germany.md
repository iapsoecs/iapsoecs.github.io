The Collaborative Research Centre TRR 181 "Energy Transfers in Atmosphere and Ocean" invites applications for 30 PhD and Postdoc positions.

TRR 181 is a collaborative project between the Universities Hamburg and Bremen (Germany) funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Further participating institutions are Alfred Wegener Institute Bremerhaven, Jacobs University, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde, Leibniz Institute for Atmospheric Physics Kühlungsborn, Goethe University Frankfurt, and Hamburg University of Technology.

Physical oceanographers, meteorologists and applied mathematicians are working together in the project

       I. to understand the energy transfers between the different dynamical regimes –
          small scale turbulence, internal gravity waves and geostrophically balanced motion
          in both atmosphere and ocean,
       II. to develop, test and implement new and consistent parameterisations in models,
       III. to develop mathematical and numerical methods featuring consistent energetics.

Successful applicants hold a MSc degree in physical oceanography, meteorology, applied mathematics or a related field and are highly motivated to work in an interdisciplinary environment.

The openings may be located at any of the participating institutions and are subject to the funding of the second phase of the research project. The earliest start of the positions is 1st January 2021. The positions are funded until June 2024.

The Collaborative Research Centre TRR 181 aims to increase the number of women in research and teaching in this field and explicitly encourages women to apply.

Details about the individual positions and application deadlines will follow soon.
