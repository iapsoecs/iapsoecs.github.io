**Job Summary**

We seek a Research Associate to join the project “Sources, Sinks and Sustainable Solutions for Impacts of Plastic on Coastal Communities in Vietnam”. This GCRF funded £2.8m project will work closely with partners in Vietnam. We’re hiring four postdocs; this one will be for someone interested in taking on a leadership and project management role with a focus on interdisciplinary research. You will have a proven track record of multidisciplinary research with a core background maybe in marine science, microplastics research or community based social sciences. The role involves significant project operations management and fieldwork effort, requiring independent working, organisational and communication skills, and solution-seeking, including in complicated and partly remote environments. We encourage disclosure of special needs to enable us to make reasonable adjustments to support you. You will work effectively as part of a larger team including other PDRAs, technicians, and PhD researchers.
