## Postdoctoral Research Associate in Simulating Nonlinear Internal Waves

### Job Summary

The Postdoctoral Research Associate will conduct high-resolution numerical modeling, data analysis, and model validation in collaboration with a multidisciplinary research team. The position offers opportunities for independent research, publication, and collaboration with leading ocean scientists as part of a multi-institutional National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP; https://nopp-giw.ucsd.edu/) effort. This full-time, 12-month position is supported by a three-year Office of Naval Research (ONR) grant. In recent global ocean simulation studies (Solano et al., 2023; Buijsman et al., 2025) it has been shown that supertidal (nonlinear) internal wave energy is enhanced in the tropics. The aim of this project is to understand nonlinear internal wave generation and dissipation, cross-scale energy transfers, wave-mean flow interactions, and nonlinear wave driven mixing in this region.
 
### Job Location

University of Southern Mississippi, School of Ocean Science and Engineering, Stennis Space Center, MS, near New Orleans, LA
 
### Primary Job Duties and Responsibilities:

* Set up a nonhydrostatic numerical model (ROMS or MITgcm) nested within regional NCOM simulations to study nonlinear internal wave dynamics near the Amazon shelf and in the Bay of Bengal.
* Share simulation output with project collaborators to inform observational cruises and mooring deployment strategies.
* Compare model results with TPXO, SWOT, and mooring observations to ensure model accuracy.
* Use advanced coarse-graining, spectral, and modal decomposition techniques to quantify energy fluxes and assess ocean mixing processes.
* Lead the preparation of approximately one first-author, peer-reviewed manuscript per year and contribute as a co-author on additional publications.
* Present research results at project meetings and (international) conferences. 

 
### Minimum Qualifications

Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography or a closely related discipline, with successful dissertation defense completed preferably by December 31, 2025. Candidates must have a publication record that illustrates the ability to conduct and communicate independent research and experience with setting up, running, and diagnosing MITgcm/ROMS/oceananigans.jl simulations, time series analysis, and internal wave processes. The successful candidate will be required to pass a USM employment background check and a NASA background security check to work at Stennis. A remote work arrangement from inside the USA can be discussed.
 
### Instructions to Applicants

Applications must be submitted through the jobs.usm.edu candidate portal https://usm.csod.com/ux/ats/careersite/1/home/requisition/5046?c=usm. Upload 1) a cover letter with a brief description of present and future research interests and how they align with the NOPP project, 2) a CV including demonstrated scholarly output (e.g., list of publications and presentations), 3) names and contact information of three references. All attachments must be uploaded at the time of submission. For questions, please contact Dr. Maarten Buijsman by email: maarten.buijsman@usm.edu (I am also at Ocean Sciences in Glasgow). Review of applications will begin December 1, 2025, and continue until the position is filled. J-1 visas can be issued for postdoctoral research scholars who qualify.
