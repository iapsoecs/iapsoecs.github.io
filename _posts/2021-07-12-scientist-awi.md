The Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) is a member of the Helmholtz Association (HGF) and funded by federal and state government. AWI focuses on polar and marine research in a variety of disciplines such as biology, oceanography, geology, geochemistry and geophysics, thus allowing multidisciplinary approaches to scientific goals.


Physical Oceanographer / Expedition Scientist (m/f/d)


Background The section Oceanography of the Polar Seas invites applications for the tenure track position of a Physical Oceanographer / Expedition Scientist (m/f/d) to support the operation of our long-term, autonomous observatories in the Polar Seas.

The physical oceanography team operates marine infrastructures to enable year-round time-series observations both in the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean, which contribute to international efforts towards comprehensive global ocean observations. The main purpose of maintaining permanent infrastructures in the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean - covering the ocean from the sea surface to the sea floor - is the provision of continuous observations for the study of ocean dynamics, sea ice decline, glacier and ice shelf retreat, climate variability and ecosystem change. The infrastructures will provide ocean data from a range of measurement platforms and sensors that will be made available to a multitude of users.


Tasks You will

- manage the oceanographic time-series programs on an operational level (under scientific guidance) in the framework of the FRAM and HAFOS observatories

- improve and further develop the measurement strategies for year-round, under-ice observation according to the scientific requests

- join expeditions and be responsible for the acquisition and high-quality processing and documentation of mooring-based and ice-tethered data

- maintain, develop and provide the software for data processing and archiving of time series data

- both compute derived quantities (e.g., volume transport, heat content, energy fluxes) from the mooring data and publish those as derived data products in data journals

- Prepare scientific expeditions including measurement equipment (such as CTD systems)

- work in close cooperation with scientists, including physical oceanographers, numerical modellers, and marine biologists as well as engineers and technicians.


Requirements

- Master (MSc) degree in physical oceanography, sea ice physics or related fields.

- Extensive experience in marine equipment operation (particularly in high-latitude and ice-covered oceans) and the analysis of sensor-based environmental (preferably marine) data.

- A strong background in high-level programming is required.

- Practical knowledge in the application of statistical methods to be used for the analyses of time series and spatial patterns is desirable.

- You should be open to interacting with an interdisciplinary and international science community and should be willing to participate in research expeditions (typically 2 months per year).

- Very good communication skills in English - both written and oral - are mandatory.
