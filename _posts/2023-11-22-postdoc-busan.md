Employer: IBS Center for Climate Physics

Location: Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea

Education Level: PhD

Job type: Postdoctoral Fellow

Salary: 54-70 million KRW/year (~40,000-52,000 USD/year)

Term: Full Time, 2 years, with the possibility of renewal

Applicants for this position should have a PhD in oceanography, meteorology, climate sciences, physics, geography, or a related field. Candidates are expected to have strong computational skills, excitement to work on a new research subject, a good publication record, a high level of independence, curiosity, and creativity, and an interest in working in an international and interdisciplinary research environment. Experience with coupled earth system models, ocean models (e.g., NEMO), ocean biogeochemical models, or coupling tools (e.g., OASIS3-MCT) is desirable.

The successful candidate will work under the guidance of Prof. Wonsun Park to develop a climate model that resolves ocean mesoscale eddies in the Northwestern Pacific. The model will be interactive with an ocean biogeochemical model. We will investigate internal variability and future changes of the western boundary current and its connection to changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and biology over the East Asian sector.

The IBS Center for Climate Physics (ICCP), (http://ibsclimate.org) directed by Dr. Axel Timmermann, is dedicated to advancing the understanding of natural climate variability, man-made climate change and their impacts on the hydrological cycle, regional processes, ice-sheets, and sea level. The ICCP is generously funded through the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) (https://ibs.re.kr). 

ICCP is located in Busan, the second largest city in South Korea and the ninth largest port city in the world. Surrounded by ocean and mountains, the city has a dramatic natural background. From designer cafes, international movie and art festivals, award-winning restaurants to temples at the end of hiking trails, Busan has something to offer for everyone. 

Please submit a cover letter (using the reference PD-01-2023), a short statement of your research interests, curriculum vitae, the name of 2 references, and up to three publications to Ms. Jenny Choi (hahadaye@pusan.ac.kr). If you have any further questions regarding this position, please contact Prof. Wonsun Park (wpark@pusan.ac.kr).
