The PhD position is entitled “Projections of future sea-level rise from coupled ice sheet-ocean modelling”. Sea-level rise is one of the most pressing aspects of climate change. Projections of its future evolution can be greatly improved by an adequate representation of critical processes, such as the ocean-cryosphere interaction at the base of the large Antarctic ice shelves.
This project’s goal is to provide global trajectories for regional sea-level change during the 21st century for different future emission scenarios. A coupled ocean–ice shelf–ice sheet model (FESOM-PISM) with evolving cavity geometries will be used to obtain projections for mass loss in the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Model results will feed into a fingerprinting method that considers the ocean response as well as gravitational effects and contributions from other sources.
