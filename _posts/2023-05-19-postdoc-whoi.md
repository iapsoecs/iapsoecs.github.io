The Climate and Paleoceanography group at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution seeks a Postdoctoral Investigator (PDI) interested in using stable isotopes and elemental ratios of foraminifera to reconstruct Indo-Pacific Warm Pool oceanographic variability on multi-decadal to centennial time scales during the last millennium. The PDI would interact with collaborators, who are using ocean and climate models for proxy-model synthesis, to interpret the results. The PDI would also contribute to studies of oceanographic variability during the last deglaciation and the Holocene.

This is a full-time, exempt position, and is eligible for benefits. The initial appointment will be for one year with the possibility of a 6-month extension.

The institution has a top-rated postdoctoral program (www.whoi.edu/postdoctoral/) that supports a dynamic postdoctoral community with formal mentoring and career guidance programs. While the primary focus of the work will be in research, the Postdoctoral Investigator will have the opportunity to participate in educational and outreach activities associated with the project.

Online application forms should be submitted with a cover letter, complete curriculum vitae, and three letters of recommendation. Applications will be reviewed upon submission.
