The Krause and Kiel Reese Laboratories at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab and Stokes School of Marine & Environmental Sciences at the University of South Alabama are seeking a full-time postdoctoral scholar to examine bacterial roles in sediment biogeochemical cycling. The position is for a one year appointment, with renewal for another two years dependent on performance and available funding. The postdoc will participate in field campaigns sampling in the Gulf of Mexico and Ross Sea (Antarctica); additional field opportunities are possible. Some on-the-job training for specific niche responsibilities will be provided (e.g. particle analysis, isotope tracer methods); however, a competitive candidate will have experience in molecular approaches (RNA/DNA extraction, purification, library preparation, etc.) and informatics. Salary is $50000 annually with benefits. The preferred start is January 2024 but is negotiable.

Qualifications and expectations:
1. Ph.D. in Oceanography, Biology, Marine Science, or related disciplines.
2. Ability to work independently and collaboratively as part of a multidisciplinary team.
3. Strong organizational and time management skills.
4. Working knowledge of quantitative data analysis.
5. Lead lab and field experiments collaboratively planned with the PIs.
6. Synthesize results and present to the community (meetings, manuscripts).
7. Participate in professional development activities and outreach.
8. Have reliable transportation to work at either the Dauphin Island Sea Lab or University of South Alabama campuses (~40 miles/~65 km apart).

Interested individuals are encouraged to contact Dr. Jeffrey Krause (jkrause@disl.edu) with the subject line ?Postdoctoral Position Bacteria? to ask any questions and/or apply for the position. Applications should include:

A. Current curriculum vitae (include contact information, current/former
academic institutions, degrees awarded, awards/honors, publications/presentations, other pertinent information); if degree is in progress, include the anticipated date of completion.
B. Names and contact information (email, phone) of three professional references.
C. 500-word (maximum) statement of purpose.

Review of applications will begin immediately, and priority given to those received before 3 November 2023.
