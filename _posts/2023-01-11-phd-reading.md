PhD: Investigating the climate feedbacks that will determine the fate
of the Greenland ice sheet.

Sea level change is one of the most widely recognised and potentially
serious consequences of climate change. The contribution of ice mass
loss is a significant but currently uncertain component of predicted
future sea level.

To address these uncertainties, this project will employ cutting-edge
numerical models of global climate and focus in on the climate-ice
interactions over Greenland. In parallel, observational data will be
used to both verify the modelâ€™s capabilities and improve its physical
parameterisations.
