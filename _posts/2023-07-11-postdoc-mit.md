POSTDOCTORAL ASSOCIATE, Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), to conduct theoretical, computational, and observational analyses research to advance the understanding of the accumulation, pathways, and consequences of global warming in the ocean under the co-direction of Dr. Gaël Forget as part of the Follows research team.  The scientific goals of the project include evaluating the degree to which Earth energy imbalance gets transferred to deep ocean layers or spatially redistributed near the sea surface where it is most impactful.  The focus will be on budgeting heat storage and its pathways within the upper 200m of the global ocean.  The research also aims to advance open science and increase climate literacy. The postdoctoral associate will be responsible for performing numerical simulations, analyzing observations, and presenting findings in peer-review journal publications and at national/international conferences.
