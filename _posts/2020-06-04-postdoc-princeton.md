The Princeton University AOS program, in collaboration with NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and the Department of Energy’s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI), seek an energetic and enthusiastic postdoctoral research associate or more senior scientist. A research position is available focused on process-oriented ocean studies using theory, modeling, and observations. The goal of this research is to develop metrics of transient tracer distributions and water mass transformations in ocean models and observations. Of particular interest is how these metrics can further elucidate pathways of ocean ventilation, heat, carbon uptake, and guide the development and improvement of global ocean and earth system models. Knowledge gained through understanding these processes will lead to improved model simulations and reduce overall uncertainty in future climate projections.

The postdoctoral researcher will join a vigorous multi-institution and interdisciplinary research team and work under the supervision of Dr. John Krasting and Dr. Stephen Griffies at NOAA/GFDL and Princeton University, in collaboration with Dr. Paul Durack and Dr. Peter Glecker at DOE/PCMDI. The researcher will be able to take advantage of a wide range of related research in oceanography, biogeochemistry, and climate science at Princeton University, NOAA/GFDL, and DOE/PCMDI. Available resources include access to state-of-the-science ocean physics and biogeochemistry models and data, simulations performed with the models, model output from CMIP3 through CMIP6, and high-performance computing environments for modeling and analysis.

Candidates must have received a Ph.D in the earth sciences, applied math, or the physical sciences within three years of the starting date for the appointment. Rigorous training in physical ocean sciences is preferred along with very strong dynamical, modeling, analytical, and quantitative skills. Postdoctoral appointments are initially for one year with the renewal for a subsequent year based on satisfactory performance and continued funding. A competitive salary is offered commensurate with experience and qualifications.

Applicants are asked to submit vitae, a statement of research experience and interests, and names of at least three references online to https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/15321. For more information about the research project and application process, please contact John.Krasting@noaa.gov and/or Stephen.Griffies@noaa.gov. Review of applications will begin as soon as they are received, and continue until the position is filled.

This position is subject to Princeton University’s background check policy.

Princeton University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
