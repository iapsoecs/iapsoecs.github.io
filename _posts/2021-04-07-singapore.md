Senior Research Fellow position in Sea Level Modeling (NEMO) at the Tropical Marine Science Institute in National University of Singapore, Singapore.

We are seeking a highly motivated researcher to lead the study on low-frequency (seasonal to decadal time scale) sea level variability over the southeast Asian and South China Sea region. The study includes the dynamical downscaling of Climate Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) coupled ocean model simulations for the historic period and for selected projection scenarios. Successful candidate must have a PhD in a physical oceanography, experience in sea level and climate change studies, numerical ocean modeling experience, and excellent technical, organisational and communication skills, both written and verbal to disseminate key results to the project partners and government stakeholders.

Qualification and Experience

-       Ph.D in physical oceanography with good understanding in sea level and climate change studies.
-       4-5 years of postdoc experience.
-       Experience in the development of regional ocean models is essential. Prior modeling experience with NEMO will be an advantage in the selection process.
-       Experience in the analysis of satellite and tide-gauge sea level observations.
-       Excellent data analysis and data visualization skills. Good technical skill in Linux shell scripting, python, matlab, pyferret or similar packages.
-       Should be able to work in a self‐directed manner and within a team environment

Initially, the position will be offered for 2 year. The position is expected start in August 2021. Review of applications will begin immediately. To apply, please send a cover letter, full CV together with names and contact information for two references via email tmsbt@nus.edu.sg (Bijoy Thompson). Only short listed candidates will be further contacted for an interview.

Please add ‘Application for the post of Sea level modeller at TMSI NUS’ in the subject line.
