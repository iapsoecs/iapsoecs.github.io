We are offering a post for a talented and imaginative research scientist on
a project which aims to reduce uncertainty in projections of anthropogenic
climate change, through understanding of forced and unforced variations in
the coupled atmosphere–ocean climate system, especially the interactions
between climate feedback, ocean heat uptake and the spatiotemporal patterns
of climate change. The work may involve analyses of results from the latest
generation of global atmosphere-ocean climate models and comparable
observational datasets, complementary and novel model experiments, and
development of conceptual models and theories. The post is for three years.
The post-holder will be a member of a small group working with the
principal investigator, as a member of staff of National Centre for
Atmospheric Science, sited in the Department of Meteorology (at present
temporarily working at home, because of COVID-19 restrictions).


The project is funded by an Advanced Grant from the European Research
Council.


Essential criteria include:

·         PhD in mathematical or physical science

·         Strong physical insight, analytical ability, creativity and
self-motivation

·         Knowledge of and interest in climate change science

·         Research experience involving GCM modelling and analysis of large
datasets
