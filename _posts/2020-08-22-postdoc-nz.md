Postdoctoral Research Fellow - Oceanographic Modelling

  *   Location: Wellington
  *   Type: Contract
  *   Post Date: Fri Aug 7 05:22:20 2020
  *   Ref: 10150

  *   Full-time, fixed-term (two years) Post-Doctoral Researcher position
  *   Are you an experienced and productive young researcher who completed their PhD in physical oceanographic modelling, connectivity or scenario modelling?
  *   Do you enjoy working in large multi-disciplinary teams?

The MOANA team (https://www.moanaproject.org/) has a fully-funded position open for application from suitably qualified researchers at the post-Doctoral level (PDF). We are particularly keen to recruit a young scientist with a demonstrated interest and skills in physical oceanographic modelling, connectivity (gene flow and larval exchange) and seafood species.

This PDF position relates to the modelling of contemporary (i.e., present-day) connectivity of seafood species. It is a 2-year position. The position will be based at Wellington (Victoria University).

The candidate must have:

  *   Completed their PhD in an appropriate discipline (physical oceanographic modelling, connectivity, scenario modelling)
  *   Have demonstrated skills and experience as a productive young researcher
  *   Be able to work as part of a large multi-disciplinary team
  *   Published peer-reviewed papers in the international literature
  *   For candidates whose first language is not English, we may require evidence (e.g., TOEFL, IELTS) of English proficiency

This PDF position will be working on the connectivity of three seafood species that are particularly important in New Zealand:

  *   paua (abalone, Haliotis iris), which have a very short pelagic larval duration of only a few days,
  *   green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus), which have a moderate pelagic duration of 28 days, and
  *   rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii), which have a very long pelagic larval duration of 18-24 months.

The successful candidate must be able to work as part of a large international and multi-disciplinary team.
