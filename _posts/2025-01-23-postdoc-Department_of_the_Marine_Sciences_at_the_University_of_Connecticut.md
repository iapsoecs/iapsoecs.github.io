## JOB SUMMARY

Faculty in the Department of the Marine Sciences at the University of Connecticut Avery Point campus invite applications for a Postdoctoral Research Associate who will aid local managers by improving the capacity to predict hypoxia in Long Island Sound.
The successful candidate will work on an EPA/NOAA-funded project investigating physical and biogeochemical drivers of hypoxia in Long Island Sound using state-of-the-art observations and models. They will collect data with a wire-following profiler (Wirewalker) in summer to fall of 2025 and interpret the data to quantify biological and physical sources and sinks of dissolved oxygen. They will analyze existing model hindcast solutions from a ROMS-RCA model and use the observational results to provide guidance on improving the model. The postdoc will have the opportunity to investigate the drivers of oxygen depletion and ventilation over hourly to seasonal timescales, including the interplay between surface waves and estuarine dynamics using the tools described above. The resulting knowledge will be presented at scientific conferences and published in scientific journals.
In addition, the postdoc will present project results during regular meetings with an advisory panel that includes representatives from local, state, and federal government who are involved in the management of Long Island Sound, giving them the opportunity to develop skills and knowledge in applied research and science policy.
The postdoctoral researcher will be co-supervised by Professors Cara Manning and Leonel Romero, and work in collaboration with Professor Samantha Siedlecki. For more information on our research, visit our lab websites (Manning<https://www.caramanning.com/>; Romero<https://www.airsealab.com/>; Siedlecki<https://samanthasiedlecki.wixsite.com/coastalbiogeodynlab>). The Department of Marine Sciences<https://marinesciences.uconn.edu/> is located at the Avery Point campus on the waters of Long Island Sound and hosts waterfront research facilities. The campus is a short drive or train ride to New York City and Boston.

## DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

* Contributes to writing the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for the project.
* Contributes to the fieldwork in summer and fall 2025, including the deployment and maintenance of the wire-following profiler (Wirewalker) and sensors.
* Uses the Wirewalker data to quantify biological and physical sources and sinks of dissolved oxygen throughout the water column, including primary production, respiration, mixing, and gas exchange.
* Uses the microstructure turbulence shear and temperature sensors to estimate turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates, and uses the meteorological, surface wave, and vertical stratification measurements to characterize the boundary layer mixing regimes.
* Uses acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements to assess the importance of lateral advection and tides to the O2 budget.
* Uses oxygen, optical backscatter, chlorophyll, and photosynthetically active radiation measurements to quantify the rates of primary production and respiration.
* Analyzes existing hindcast solutions from a hydrodynamic model (ROMS-RCA), as well as historical data compiled by EPA to find time periods statistically similar to the period sampled with the Wirewalker and evaluates the model-data mismatch.
* Collaborates with the Siedlecki lab members to alter the ROMS-RCA model by implementing new parameterizations that account for bubble-mediated gas exchange and wave-mediated mixing, and developing a nested downscaled version of the model.
* Collaborates with the Siedlecki lab to assess how these changes influence the predictions of hypoxia in Long Island Sound.
* Communicates the project results and recommendations to management partners at advisory panel meetings and at scientific conferences.
* Writes and revises manuscripts for scientific journals.
* Develops and revises an individual development plan (IDP) in collaboration with their faculty mentors and participates in professional development opportunities available through the university.


## MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

* Doctoral degree in oceanography or a related discipline at the date of appointment.
* Experience using computer programming (e.g., Python, MATLAB, and/or other similar tools) for scientific research.


## PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS

* Experience conducting oceanographic field work, including deploying, recovering, and maintaining scientific equipment (e.g., moorings, gliders, floats, sensors, etc.).
* Experience in quality control of data from oceanographic sensors such as acoustic Doppler current profilers, microstructure sensors, wave sensors, conductivity, temperature, pressure, oxygen, and/or bio-optical sensors.
* Experience analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing output from hydrodynamic models or other very large data sets/model fields.
* Lead author of scientific publications and/or submitted manuscripts related to their expertise.
* Experience successfully collaborating with a team to conduct interdisciplinary research.


## APPOINTMENT TERMS
This is a full-time, end-dated position with the possibility of renewal subject to performance and funding. This project includes postdoctoral salary support for up to two years, pending satisfactory progress during the first year. The preferred appointment date is April 4, 2025 or earlier, but employees requesting a later start date will be considered. The University offers a competitive salary, and outstanding benefits<https://hr.uconn.edu/employee-benefits-overview/>, including employee and dependent tuition waivers at UConn, and access to employer-sponsored retirement plans with matching funds. Salary will be commensurate with experience and is expected to be based on the National Research Service Award (NRSA) Post Doctoral Fellow stipend scale which is available on the UConn website<https://ovpr.uconn.edu/services/sps/proposals/proposal-preparation/general-cost-principles/budgeting-costing-guide/salaries/>. Anticipated initial annual salary for a person with no prior postdoctoral experience is $61,008.
Postdoctoral Research Associates employed at UConn are represented by the UConn Graduate Employee and Postdoc Union (GEU-UAW Local 6950). Other rights and terms and conditions of the appointment are contained in the collective bargaining agreement between the University of Connecticut and the GEU-UAW Local 6950.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT
