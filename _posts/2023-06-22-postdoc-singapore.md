This position will undertake marine-based climate research and lead the further development of CCRS high resolution regional Southeast Asia marine modelling capabilities based on km-scale configurations of the Nucleus for Environmental Modelling (NEMO) system. Target applications for this work include coupled environmental prediction (i.e. weather/ ocean/ wave forecasting) and regional climate model dynamical downscaling to provide localised sea level rise estimates.

 

**What the role is**

The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) is a division of the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). At CCRS, our mission is to advance scientific understanding of tropical climate variability and change and its associated weather systems affecting Singapore and the wider Southeast Asia region, so that the knowledge and expertise can benefit decision makers and the community. Our vision is to be a world leading centre in tropical climate and weather research focusing on the Southeast Asia region.

Within CCRS, the Department for Weather Research (DWR) leads the research and development (R&D) of our core tropical, convective-scale ‘SINGV’ modelling system for both weather and climate change applications. DWR also undertakes R&D and oversees the transition to operations of SINGV-based local numerical weather prediction (NWP), marine and haze/air quality forecasting with lead times up to a week ahead. The DWR works closely with CCRS’s Department of Climate Research (DCR) and High Performance Computing (HPC) Branch, MSS forecasters, local universities, and a number of international organisations including the UK Met Office, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and US National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Since 2022, CCRS has been a core member of the international Unified Model (UM) partnership.

The DWR’s Core Modelling Development (CMD) branch is responsible for developing CCRS’s core ‘SINGV’ modelling capabilities, with a focus on the representation of the underlying physical and dynamical processes governing weather and climate in Southeast Asian region. The CMD branch works closely with other CCRS branches to further evaluate the core SINGV system in specific weather and climate change applications, and with local agencies and institutes of higher learning to share research outcomes and further develop advanced modelling systems for the region.

This position will undertake marine-based climate research and lead the further development of CCRS high resolution regional Southeast Asia marine modelling capabilities based on km-scale configurations of the Nucleus for Environmental Modelling (NEMO) system. Target applications for this work include coupled environmental prediction (i.e. weather/ ocean/ wave forecasting) and regional climate model dynamical downscaling to provide localised sea level rise estimates.

 

**What you will be working on**

The specific job responsibilities of this position include:

• Lead and initiate new, innovative research in our understanding of the Southeast Asia physical ocean system, covering processes with timescales from days to centuries, publishing in reputable scientific journals.
• Oversee and contribute to the planning and development of the NEMO-based ocean component of CCRS’s climate modelling system, working as part of a broader team to develop coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave capabilities for applications on weather and climate change timescales.
• Maintain advanced skills and knowledge as a leading scientific researcher and guide more junior researchers.
• Work with local and international institutes to cultivate relevant research collaborations and partnerships.
• Communicate relevant research findings to relevant stakeholders through verbal briefings and reports, and to the international scientific community through invited presentations.

 

**What we are looking for**

Candidate requirements:

• PhD degree (or equivalent) in marine sciences, fluid dynamics or a related field
• At least 10 years of research experience in an area of high-resolution ocean modelling, and/or applying such models in weather and climate research
• A proven record of success as demonstrated by publications in peer-reviewed journals
• Membership in relevant international scientific working groups and/or expert teams
• The ability to supervise and coach less experienced team members in conducting research projects
• High level of proficiency in scientific programming (e.g., Fortran, Python) and experience of using HPC
• Experience working as part of a multi-disciplinary, international scientific team
• Ability to work effectively to deadlines on individual projects and as part of a diverse team
• Interest and passion to deliver relevant R&D for societal benefits
• Ability to network effectively with the local and international research community
• Excellent communication skills both written and verbal and across technical and non-technical materials
• As part of the shortlisting process for this role, you may be required to complete a medical declaration and/or undergo further assessment.
