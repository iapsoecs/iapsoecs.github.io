Full time, Research Focused, Fixed-Term for up to 3 years

We are seeking to appoint a Postdoctoral Research Associate (PDRA) in Physical Oceanography in the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies which is part of the College of Sciences and Engineering.

The position is funded by a grant from the Australian Research Council Discovery Project “Unraveling ocean mixing and air-sea forcing along the Indo-Pacific exchange”, a collaborative project with investigators from the University of Tasmania, CSIRO Environment and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The aim of the project is to collect unprecedented observations using novel profiling floats and to develop high resolution model simulations to examine changes in the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) north of Australia. The main objectives of the project are to quantify internal wave characteristics and mixing that accomplish the cooling and freshening of the ITF, changes in the ITF vertical structure within the seas, and interactions with the atmosphere. This project expects to develop new knowledge of ocean-atmosphere interactions along the path of the ITF from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, which are the powerhouse that drives changes in winds and rainfall around Australia and the entire Indo-Pacific region. This ARC project enables a significant Australian contribution to a major international field experiment, Measurements and Modeling of the Indonesian Throughflow (MINTIE), which is a collaboration between USA, Indonesia, China and Australia.

Essential Selection Criteria:

    A PhD in Physical Oceanography or an equivalent field.
    Knowledge of atmosphere/ocean dynamics and climate processes and postdoctoral experience commensurate with the level of appointment, as demonstrated by a record of quality publications.
    High level quantitative skills, as demonstrated through analysis and interpretation of complex ocean/atmosphere datasets or numerical simulations.
    Demonstrated ability to work efficiently and independently, with a capacity to set and prioritize strategic research direction to achieve scientific goals and funding milestones.
    Demonstrated ability to work collaboratively in a research team to achieve collective as well as individual outcomes.
    A record of contributing to building and maintaining effective and productive networks within the discipline and wider community.

Other Desirable Criteria:

    Experience in research related to the Indo-Pacific exchange and/or the dynamics of internal waves and mixing.

Appointment to this role will be at Academic Level A or level B and can have a total remuneration package of up to $147,083 comprising base salary within the range of $78,499 to $125, 712 plus 17% superannuation.
