A postdoctoral scholar position for 2 years is available at Oregon State University’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences under the direction of Dr. Andreas Schmittner. Effects of (i) internal waves and (ii) mesoscale eddies on ocean mixing will be explored in global climate models. Simulations of present-day and ice-age oceans will be conducted and compared to observations to assess how mixing affects ocean circulation, climate, and the cycling of biogeochemical and isotope tracers.

Applicants, particularly those from groups that are currently underrepresented in climate modeling, with a Ph.D. in oceanography, climate science, physics or a related field, and experience in numerical modeling are encouraged to apply. Please send your CV and cover letter with the names and contact information of three references to andreas.schmittner@oregonstate.edu.

Salary: Commensurate with qualifications and experience as per OSU guidelines (https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/postdocs/stipends-and-benefits)

The position will be open until filled, at least until Sep. 30, 2023.

Preferable start date: Oct. 2023 – Jan. 2024.
