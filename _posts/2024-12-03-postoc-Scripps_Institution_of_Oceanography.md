Postdoc Opportunity in Biogeochemical State Estimation in the SOCCOM3 Project

Postdoctoral Scholar-Employee Position at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD  with Matthew Mazloff, Lynne Talley, Sarah Gille, and Ariane Verdy:

This position contributes to quantifying and explaining the Southern Ocean carbon cycle.  The postdoctoral researcher will help develop and analyze a Biogeochemical Global Ocean State Estimate (BGOSE; http://sose.ucsd.edu/) as part of the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project (https://soccom.princeton.edu/).  The SOCCOM mission is explained at https://soccom.princeton.edu/content/overview. Towards this mission, the candidate will examine mechanisms governing the carbon budget in BGOSE and assess processes accounting for discrepancies between BGOSE and biogeochemical (BGC) observations, including BGC Argo floats. Emphasis will also be on BGOSE analysis for providing context to the BGC observations and for investigating physical drivers of biogeochemical variability. Contact Matt Mazloff (mmazloff@ucsd.edu) for further information.

 

Responsibilities:

-   	Investigate the Southern Ocean carbon state in support of the SOCCOM project goals (https://soccom.princeton.edu/)

-   	Collaborate with the SOCCOM project, the ECCO consortium (https://www.ecco-group.org/), and the ongoing observational, modeling, and state estimation research activities underway at Scripps Institution of Oceanography

-   	Contribute to the production of mapped BGC products, including BGOSE.

-   	Analyze and interpret BGOSE in the context of BGC-Argo observations.

-   	Disseminate research findings via presentations and peer-reviewed journals.

 

Qualifications Required and Preferred Academic Background:

 

Applicants should have 0-2 years of postdoctoral experience or be nearing completion of their Ph.D. (estimated within 3 months) and be self-motivated.  Good written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to produce scientific publications and presentations and meet project milestones, are required. Also required is a strong analytical background with a Ph.D. in biogeochemical or physical oceanography or a related field.  Programming experience working in a Unix environment with experience in scripting languages such as Fortran, Python, and Matlab is desired. Other desired qualifications include experience with in situ and satellite biogeochemical observations, numerical modeling, assimilation, and data analysis. A theoretical background in the oceanic carbon cycle and ecosystem dynamics is also desired. The successful candidate must provide documentation that they have completed all the requirements of their doctoral degree by the time the appointment begins. 

 

Appointment Length/Period: The initial appointment is for two years, with an extension possible contingent upon candidate eligibility, performance, and eligibility of funding.  The desired start date is April 1, 2025, or by mutual agreement.

Salary Range: ​A reasonable salary range estimate for this position is $66,000-75,000/yr. ​

 

Application Closing Date:  open until filled, with preference to applications received by January 6, 2025.

 

Job Location: La Jolla, CA

Application Procedure:  Please contact Dr. Matthew Mazloff via email at mmazloff@ucsd.edu with a CV, a personal statement of the candidate’s experience and career goals, and the names and email contact information for three referees.

The University of California, San Diego is an AA/EOE.
