GMRI (https://gmri.org/) is seeking applicants for a Sea Level Rise
Postdoctoral Research Associate to work under the supervision of Dr. Dave Reidmiller
(https://gmri.org/our-approach/staff/david-reidmiller/), Director of GMRI's
Climate Center (https://gmri.org/commitments/strategic-initiatives/climate-center/). The
incumbent will join a rapidly growing Climate Center team that is working
to integrate and elevate the climate-related work across the organization
while charting new directions for us to provide climate services to
waterfront communities and businesses across the region. The incumbent
would work closely with other GMRI staff, such as our Municipal Climate
Action Program Manager, to develop high-resolution sea level rise
projections (spatially and temporally) for coastal areas throughout
northern New England and communicate those results to key constituencies. A
core aim of this work is to provide greater regional specificity to how
coastlines - and the businesses, communities, and ecosystems that call them
home - are expected to evolve and adapt over the coming decades. Coastlines
throughout the Gulf of Maine vary substantially in their geologic
complexity which, when coupled with the large tidal ranges and complex
oceanographic processes present in the region, results in a high degree of
spatial variability with respect to community-level sea level rise
impacts - an issue we aspire to help address through this position.
