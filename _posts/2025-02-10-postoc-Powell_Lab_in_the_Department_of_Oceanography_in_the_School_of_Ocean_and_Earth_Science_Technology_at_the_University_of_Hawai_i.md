# University of Hawai'i Postdoctoral Scholar in Pacific Island Oceanic Ecosystem Dynamics


A minimum three-year postdoctoral scholar position is available to join the Powell Lab <https://powellb.oceanmodeling.org> in the Department of Oceanography in the School of Ocean and Earth Science Technology at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (UH). You will join an effort to develop an understanding of the fundamental physical, ecological, and biogeochemical connections between the coral, coastal, and pelagic ecosystems along the Hawaiian Island Chain, and how they are sensitive to changes in the ocean. Using brand-new, advanced numerical regional coupled models MOM6/COBALT, we will examine how islands provide refuge in the oligotrophic ocean and what the impact of a changing climate will mean to each ecosystem. These Pacific Islands face immediate and existential threats. This effort is part of a multi-institutional collaborative effort Climate, Ecosystems, and Fisheries Initiative (CEFI).


The successful candidate will join a dynamic lab environment at UH with extensive expertise in advanced numerical modeling with diverse scientific projects. In addition, they will become part of a larger community at NOAA GFDL and around the country building the scientific capacity for MOM6/COBALT to study regional and climate issues. The position will be responsible for performing and validating ocean model simulations with the new MOM6/COBALT, and producing analyses to develop fundamental understanding of the ecosystem's physical and biogeochemical connections and sensitivities. It is expected that the successful candidate will publish scientific articles and will have opportunities to contribute to and/or write new funding proposals to develop their own program. Competitive candidates will come from a background in oceanography (or related field) with understanding of physical and biogeochemical dynamics and experience or willingness to learn modeling frameworks, their limitations, and their strengths for advancing our understanding.


Minimum Qualifications include: Ph.D. or equivalent in oceanography (or related field), ability to work well independently as part of a team, and strong communication skills both verbal and written. Preferred candidates will have strong mathematical and computational skills with some experience in numerical modeling (anywhere from small process models to full global climate models). Candidates should be motivated to drive new developments in modeling analysis and/or frameworks and be interested in interdisciplinary science that spans from physics to fish.


The appointment will be reviewed annually and renewed based upon performance and funding. Salary is commensurate with qualifications and experience. Review of applications will begin immediately, and will proceed until the position is filled. Electronic applications containing: (1) cover letter explaining how you meet the position qualifications and detailing your research interests; (2) curriculum vitae; (3) one first (or second) author published academic article most indicative of your work; (4) contact information for three references. All applications and questions should be directed to Dr. Brian Powell <powellb@hawaii.edu>. Email verification will be sent upon receipt of your application, please inquire if receipt is not received.


The University of Hawai'i is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, veteran status, or disability. Applications from women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are encouraged.
