We invite applications for *two 2-year postdoc positions in Climate Physics* at Imperial College London, with a focus on climate feedbacks and climate dynamics. The successful applicants will work under the supervision of Dr Paulo Ceppi.

 

There is some flexibility in the research goals. Possible areas include developing observational constraints on cloud and non-cloud feedbacks; investigating the two-way coupling between the radiation budget and climate responses; and developing new theoretical frameworks to understand the climate response to external forcing.

 

The closing date is *20 February*. Informal enquiries about the positions are welcome (p.ceppi@imperial.ac.uk).
