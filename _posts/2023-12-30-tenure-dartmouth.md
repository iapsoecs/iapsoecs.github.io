The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth invites applications for a tenured or tenure-track faculty position at the Assistant or Associate Professor level in the Department of Estuarine and Ocean Sciences (DEOS) at the School for Marine Science and Technology (SMAST) beginning in September 2024. We are searching for creative and innovative scholars with a demonstrated record for high-impact research commensurate with years since PhD, and a commitment to teaching, mentoring, and external impact that contributes a strong university community. We seek candidates with research interests in four major areas:

1)      Ocean and Climate Observations
2)      Ocean and Climate Large Data Set Analysis and Modelling
3)      Marine / Coastal Biogeochemistry
4)      Oceanographic Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis.

Faculty in the Department of Estuarine and Ocean Sciences pursue state-of-the-art basic and applied marine science research as well as quality graduate education, with strong interdisciplinary emphasis and high priority placed on the development of innovative approaches and technologies, and the training of the next generation of marine scientists for academia, government, and the private sector. The present hire is part of a new phase of growth for DEOS and SMAST overall. The Department offers MS and PhD degrees in Marine Science including a Dual-Degree PhD program with University of Sao Paulo, Brazil as well as a Professional Science Master. Current faculty and student research spans a range of disciplines, with funding from a variety of federal, state, municipal and private sources. For more departmental faculty and laboratory details, please visit www.umassd.edu/smast/departments/estuarine-and-ocean-sciences/.

Situated in southeastern coastal Massachusetts, SMAST hosts nearly 100,000 square feet of marine facilities located in on the shore of Clark’s Cove in New Bedford (the No. 1 fishing port by value in the US). Major facilities include a marine pier with observing assets, a more than 6,000 sq. ft. seawater laboratory, a 96,000 gallon acoustic-optic test tank, a marine biodegradability laboratory, and state-of-art conference facilities. The campus is about an hour south of Boston, a half-hour east of Providence, and a half-hour west of Cape Cod. SMAST offers graduate degree programs which focus on interdisciplinary basic-to-applied marine sciences and the development of related innovative technologies (https://www.umassd.edu/smast/). In addition to the scholarly marine science and technology communities, the SMAST mission also includes interaction with regional industry, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations on regional marine-related issues and technological development. The SMAST marine science campus, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, creates a major marine science hub in the Northeast US, bringing together more than 150 faculty, students, and staff engaged in education, research and policy related to commercial fishing, coastal preservation, ocean observation, climate change, and offshore renewable energy development.

UMass Dartmouth is the only Massachusetts national research university south of Boston and serves as a catalyst for the development of marine science and technology industries along the south coast of Massachusetts. UMass Dartmouth offers a world-class education to more than 7,500 undergraduate and graduate students each year in nearly 60 undergraduate and 50 graduate (MS & PhD) programs offered by the School for Marine Science and Technology, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Engineering, Charlton College of Business, School of Law, College of Visual and Performing Arts, and College of Nursing.

This hire is part of broader efforts by UMass Dartmouth to strengthen and expand marine research and education to take advantage of the South Coast and New Bedford region’s emergence and growing position as a central hub for the blue economy, including regional and national investment in research and technology, engaged coastal communities, and the offshore wind energy industry. The successful candidate will expand the existing missions of the Department of Estuarine and Ocean Sciences (DEOS), and have the potential to collaborate with other marine science relevant units at UMass Dartmouth, including in the Department of Fisheries Oceanography, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Engineering, and the Charlton College of Business.

Tenured and Tenure-track faculty members at SMAST are expected to develop independent research programs that attract external funding; teach courses at the graduate and undergraduate level; supervise students and postdocs in their area of research; and participate in service to the department, school, university, and discipline. Candidates must have an earned PhD in a field relevant to the position applied for, have an excellent record of scholarly work, and a commitment to teaching and mentoring a diverse student body.
