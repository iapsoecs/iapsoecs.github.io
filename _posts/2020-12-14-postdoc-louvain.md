The Georges Lemaître Centre for Earth and Climate Research (TECLIM;
www.uclouvain.be/teclim) / Earth and Life Institute of the Université
catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium is seeking
a postdoctoral fellow for participation to the JPI Climate & Oceans
project MEDLEY (MixED Layer hEterogeneitY) coordinated by the
Laboratoire d'Océanographie Physique et Spatiale, Brest, France. The
overall objective of this project is to evaluate the spatial
heterogeneity of the ocean mixed layer dynamics and improve its
representation in global climate models.

The successful candidate will contribute to (1) diagnose the spatial
heterogeneity of the mixed layer dynamics in ice-covered regions in
models of different resolutions, (2) assess the impact of fragmented sea
ice on air-sea fluxes in those models and (3) analyze the role of
ice-ocean feedbacks in controlling the spatial heterogeneity of the
mixed layer depth. He/she will also contribute to improve and test
parameterizations of the spatial heterogeneity of the mixed layer
dynamics in the NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean;
www.nemo-ocean.eu) model at a resolution similar to the one used in
global climate models, with focus on polar oceans.

The successful candidate should have a PhD in ocean modelling or related
field. Experience in polar oceanography is an asset. Advanced
programming, post-processing and data managment/analysis skills are
required. He/she should be fluent in English due to the multiple
interactions planned with other project partners and should have
demonstrated ability in team working.

The position is offered for 30 months, from February 2021, with a
possible 6-month extension. Note that it is only accessible to
researchers who did not spend the last 2 years in a Belgian lab and who
have less than 6-yr experience after their PhD thesis defense. The
salary will be commensurate with experience according to the UCLouvain
rates.

Applicants should send before January 15, 2021 (i) a statement of
research experience, qualification and interest, (ii) a complete CV
including a list of publications, and (iii) two letters of
recommendation via e-mail to Prof. Thierry Fichefet
(thierry.fichefet@uclouvain.be).
