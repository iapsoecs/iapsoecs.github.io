National University of Singapore (NUS) has an immediate vacancy in the area of global tide and storm-surge modelling in the warming climate. The Project is funded for 4 years, and includes sensitivity study of global astronomic tides and storm surges to sea level rise and CMIP6 GCMs atmospheric projections for 21st century.

The successful candidate will be responsible for:

-analysis of regional (South-East Asia) sea level rise and variability in the warming climate;

-setting and validation of Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM, https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/ GTSM/) for the Globe with a mesh refined at South-East Asia and Singapore waters;

-understanding mechanisms of global and regional astronomic tides and storm surges formation, variability and trends for ensemble of atmospheric projections and increasing global/regional sea level.

-running XBeach model for selected coastal adaptation solutions using GTSM projections as boundary conditions. 

 Successful candidate will be having the following knowledge, skills and experience:

    Understanding of mechanisms of storm surges, astronomic tides, and wind-waves generation and propagation at various scales, from global to local. 
    Understanding of mechanisms of ocean/coastal responses to the climate change.
    Capability to use modern methods of ocean data analysis, particular applied for sea level and climate research;
    Experience with OpenDA methods and software is an advantage;
    Ability to work in multidisciplinary team of researchers, including ocean/coastal and atmosphere scientists;
    Solid publication record.  

 
Candidate will be having Ph.D. in ocean/coastal sciences/engineering from a reputable University. Salary range: S$ 5,000 - S$ 7,000 monthly.

The appointment will be made in Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI), established within National University of Singapore (NUS) in partnership with PUB (Singaporeâ€™s National Water Agency).
