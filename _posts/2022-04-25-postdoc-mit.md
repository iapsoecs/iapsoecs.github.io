Prof. Wanying Kangâ€™s group at MIT now has an opening for postdoc associate to work on ocean dynamics and ocean-ice interaction on icy satellites. Since icy moons are one of the most promising targets for life detection beyond earth, the group is trying to understand how potential biosignatures may be transported by ocean circulation and wave dynamics and how to infer the properties of the subsurface oceans from their ice shell geometries or other directly observable quantities. 

Requirements: Candidates with a PhD in atmospheric or oceanic dynamics or planetary sciences are encouraged to apply. Working experience with programming languages such as python, fortran, matlab, or similar is expected, and some familiarity with numerical simulation and large-scale atmospheric/oceanic dynamics will be beneficial. 

Start date: 1 July 2022 or later. Application deadline: 15 May 2022

Contact: Potential candidates are welcome to contact  me at wanying@mit.edu, with a complete CV and a short description of research interests.
