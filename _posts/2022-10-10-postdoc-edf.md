Put your passion and skills to work for the planet. Climate change is the most urgent issue of our time, and we need people like you to help us build a vital Earth - for everyone.

We're Environmental Defense Fund, a fast-paced nonprofit with a growing staff of more than 850 people in nearly 30 countries. We deliver game-changing solutions that cut climate pollution and strengthen people's ability to thrive despite the effects climate change is already having. We work wherever we can have the most impact, from local communities to top companies to governments worldwide, and even in space.

Our culture, values (https://www.edf.org/our-mission-and-values) and commitment to diversity (https://www.edf.org/diversity) make EDF an exciting and meaningful place to work. Every job here makes a difference. Won't you join us?

We kindly ask individuals interested in applying to this position to include a cover letter as well as 1-3 supplementary writing/work samples with their CVs by a deadline of October 21, 2022.

Position Details:

This is a full-time position on a fixed-term contract through June 2024 with possibiilty for renewal. The position can be performed either 100% remotely from home within the U.S. or on a hybrid arrangement out of any U.S.-based EDF office.

Program Overview

The goal of EDF's Ocean Science Program is to deliver the science that will help build resilient oceans that provide more fish in the water, more - and more secure - food on the plate and more prosperous fishing communities, all over the world, even with climate change.  In recent years, we have focused on the science behind robust transformations of fisheries management in the U.S., China, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Belize, Cuba and Europe, working in partnership with diverse stakeholders and coastal communities. Scientific priorities include developing new approaches to understand and address the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, including not only resilient fisheries, but also complementary engagements that enhance marine and coastal ecosystem resilience and human wellbeing, especially for disadvantaged and vulnerable populations.

Overall Function

Under the supervision of the Senior Director for Ocean Science, the Oceans Science team seeks a Ph.D. level Marine Biogeochemical Scientist to work collaboratively with other EDF scientists, economists, and program experts to help develop and advocate science-based climate solutions to improve ecosystem health and provide economically sound, fair and equitable environmental outcomes, geared towards attaining ocean climate resilience for fisheries around the world. The Scientist will work closely with the EDF Oceans Science Team and the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) on key scientific priorities, especially around blue carbon and innovative nature-based solutions to address climate change, overfishing, biodiversity and habitat threats, and environmental justice concerns. Work will involve activities such as building models that help address climate change effects on marine ecosystems and identifying potential pilot interventions that could serve as proof points for interventions
 and strategies suited to improving fisheries in a changing climate, enhancing food security and nutritional outcomes from aquatic foods, and identifying strategies to build resilience to climate change across the socio-economic aspects of various fisheries and with an accounting of equity and environmental justice outcomes.  Additionally, the Scientist will work with closely with colleagues within the Oceans Science team, OCS, People & Nature and Political Affairs teams to ensure that EDF's action, advocacy and communications on natural climate solutions (NCS) and carbon dioxide reduction (CDR) techniques are science-based.
