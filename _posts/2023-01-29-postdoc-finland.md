I am looking for a postdoctoral researcher (or researcher with equivalent
experience) for a temporary position up to 28 months, preferably starting
by 1.5.2023, to further develop the sympagic and pelagic components of the
BFM model (http://www.bfm-community.eu), a state-of-the art marine biogeochemical
model, which will be run standalone and in coupled configurations with 1D
and 3D ocean-sea ice physical models under my supervision.

The work is part of the EU Horizon 2020 project “Climate Relevant
interactions and feedbacks: the key role of sea ice and Snow in the polar
and global climate system” (CRiceS) (https://www.crices-h2020.eu/). The
project brings together 20 partner institutes from the Europe, Canada,
South Africa, and India.

The position will be based in the Freshwater and Marine Solutions Unit at
SYKEs Helsinki office.
