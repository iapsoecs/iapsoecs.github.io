NCAR seeks a postdoctoral researcher to conduct research on improving climate
models. This work is part of a new exciting international collaboration,
M2LInES <https://m2lines.github.io/>: Multiscale Machine Learning In
coupled Earth System Modeling, with climate and data scientists from New
York University, Princeton, GFDL, Columbia, LDEO, NCAR, MIT, CNRS-IGE, and
CNRS-IPSL.

The research at NCAR will focus on development of machine-learned sea-ice
parameterizations using high resolution observational information.
