The College of Marine Science at the University of South Florida (USF) is seeking a Scientific Researcher in the field of Oceanography.  This position collaborates with a principal investigator to conduct research in ocean biogeochemical and physical interactions, and to understand the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and in climate. This requires in-depth and practical knowledge of oceanography and climate science as well as specialized research software and data analysis experience and a desire to make oceanographic data more open and accessible.

Responsibilities include, but not limited to:

 - Provides design support and supervision of deployment of autonomous platforms.
 - Conducts scientific research and training of students/technicians in data processing and analysis protocols.
 - Analyzes data from remote biogeochemical sensors on ships and autonomous platforms (profiling floats, uncrewed sailing vehicles, subsurface gliders), satellites, publicly available datasets and data products, and output from numerical models such as Earth System Models.
 - Performs literature reviews to assist with project development and execution.
 - Prepares research papers as co-author for publication in peer-reviewed journals, prepares project reports, and contributes significantly to the preparation of grant proposals.


Minimum Qualifications:  This position requires a Master’s degree in a natural science related to the specific area of research and two years of research experience. Doctoral study in a directly related field may substitute for the required experience. There is no substitution of experience allowed for the Master’s degree, as that is a mandatory qualification for positions assigned to this job class.

Preferred Qualifications:  Master’s degree in Chemical or Physical Oceanography.  Proficiency with data analysis using Python, Pandas, Xarray, Dask, version control, and cloud computing. Experience or interest in Open Science practices is strongly preferred.

The position is available immediately, with an initial 1-year appointment. The appointment can be extended, contingent upon satisfactory performance and funding availability.

The College of Marine Science at USF is a rapidly expanding group spanning all of the major marine science disciplines. We encourage interested applicants to review our research programs by visiting our web site at: <http://www.marine.usf.edu>.
