University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher interested in chemical oceanography / ocean biogeochemistry to work with Prof. Seth Bushinsky and join a recently funded NASA project. The goal of the project is to better understand the relative role of the biogeochemical and physical processes governing the Southern Ocean’s carbon uptake. They seek to determine how Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Waters accumulate anthropogenic carbon and transport nutrients into the ocean interior. The project will involve the use of biogeochemical profiling float data, satellite observations, and ocean state estimate output. The postdoc will also interact and meet with project co-PI [Dr. Ivana Cerovečki](https://icerovecki.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who is in charge of the analysis of physical processes.

Desired qualifications: PhD in Chemical or Physical Oceanography. Experience working with large observational datasets and model output is preferred.  This is a 3-year position, subject to annual reviews of continued satisfactory performance. Salary ~$72,000 per year, plus benefits.

Applications must be submitted through [RCUH](https://www.hirenethawaii.com/vosnet/jobbanks/jobdetails.aspx?enc=93Iq7cbf4wxXV4gFZceyHS7ZKbuk8K3ED/TLuVRadFopLEH48icoIYfTDsDCtTn801y85YZt/8JS6MiNP5N11Sc7+jB0uXAdE1q6xGgu/2cMoOlOuNC62j0v0pxs+2tv), with initial review starting Sept. 1, 2022. Please contact me with any questions: seth.bushinsky@hawaii.edu.

As a side note, I have a student working on a related topic in the Kuroshio Extension of the NW Pacific to better understand the role of subtropical mode waters in driving ocean biogeochemistry, with the focus on carbon and oxygen uptake, so we will have a number of people working on this topic as part of an interdisciplinary research group.
