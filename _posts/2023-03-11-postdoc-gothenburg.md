I am looking for a Postdoc in carbon cycle science to work with me at the Department of Space, Earth and Environment (https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/see/) at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.

The detailed research project is quite flexible and will involve studying carbon fluxes between the surface and atmosphere using observations, bottom-up modeling, and top-down inverse modeling and data assimilation methods. The work will be connected to wider projects focusing on quantifying anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions, such as the EU-funded AVENGERS project.

The full advertisement can be found here:

This is a full-time position for two years, with the possibility to extend to three years contingent on performance and funding.

The deadline for the application is 31 March 2023.

Feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries about the position: hans.chen@chalmers.se
