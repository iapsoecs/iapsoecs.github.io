We are looking for a **36-month postdoc in physical oceanography to work
at LOPS-IFREMER** in the framework of the Horizon Europe EPOC project
(Explaining and Predicting the Ocean Conveyor:
https://epoc.blogs.uni-hamburg.de/). We would be grateful if you could
share this email with any qualified candidates (apologies for any
cross-postings).

The objective of the position is to use a mooring dataset and a
submesocale-resolving regional simulation to analyse the dynamics of the
deep western boundary current across the subpolar-subtropical
"Transition Zone " of the North Atlantic (Flemish Cap and the Grand
Banks). Emphasis will be put on the propagation of buoyancy and bottom
pressure anomalies along the boundary, and their roles in setting or
breaking the meridional coherence of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation.

A detailed job description and application guidelines are available at:

Deadline for application: 31/05/2024
