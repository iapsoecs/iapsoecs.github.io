Post-Doctoral Researcher/Senior Post Doctoral Researcher
(Climate/Ocean/Atmospheric Scientist)

(24-month contract to 31th August 2024)

We are seeking a Post-Doctoral Researcher to work on the Irish Marine Institute funded project A4 to work on observational constraints of climate models to better understand ocean circulation, sea level, and climate change in the industrial era. The A4 (Aigéin, Aeráid, agus athrú Atlantaigh—Oceans, Climate, and Atlantic Change) is led by Dr Gerard McCarthy and targets three areas of physical oceanography and climate research where impactful and strategically important progress can be made. These areas are: understanding Atlantic variability, especially the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, advancing knowledge of Irish Sea level change in an Atlantic context; and development of predictive capacity on decadal timescales for planning and management. The goal of this post is to bring these three strands together in a climate model and observational constraint framework.
