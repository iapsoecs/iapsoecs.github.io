Post-doctoral scientist position at the UCLouvain, Belgium: influence of
ocean mesoscale eddies in polar regions on atmospheric dynamics

The position is open within the Horizon Europe project ‘European Eddy-Rich
Earth System Models’ (EERIE, https://eerie-project.eu/) which gathers 17
leading institutes from Europe and beyond. The goal of EERIE is to
understand the role of ocean mesoscale processes on climate variability and
changes over seasonal to centennial time scales in order to improve climate
predictions and projections. This implies the development of new Earth
System Models able to explicitly represent the ocean mesoscale and its
impact on the climate dynamics as well as the analysis of new simulations
performed with those models. The main contributions of UCLouvain in the
project are related to polar regions and their interactions with lower
latitudes.

In this framework, applications are open for the following position:

Post-doctoral researcher

Starting date: Ideally in November/December 2023 but can be negotiated

Full time position for 24 months with possibility to extend to 36 months

Net monthly salary: 2800-3100 € (depending on seniority - this includes
social insurance). Transportation to and from the workplace is covered.
Location: Earth and Life Institute, Université catholique de Louvain,
Belgium

The candidates must not have spent more than 2 years in Belgium over the
last 3 years and should not have obtained their PhD more than 6 years
before the starting date of the grant.

The post-doctoral scientist will be responsible for the analysis of
existing simulations with Earth System Models able to represent oceanic
mesoscale processes in order to quantify the impact of the eddies in polar
regions on the atmosphere. The analysis will cover a broad range of scales
from the local modifications above the eddies to changes in large-scale
atmospheric circulation and teleconnections and how this potentially feeds
back on the ocean variability. A particular focus will be paid to the role
of sea ice in modulating the atmosphere-ocean interactions.

Required qualifications:

- To have a PhD in climatology or related field;
  
- To have published in peer-reviewed international journals;
  
- To have strong experience in programming and in managing large data sets;
  
- To have demonstrated good verbal and written communication skills in English;
  
- To have interest in working in a multidisciplinary team environment.

Previous experience in polar climate dynamics or in modelling is an asset.

Applicants should send an e-mail to Hugues Goosse (hugues.goosse@uclouvain.be) including (i) a statement of research
experience, qualification and interest, (ii) a complete CV including a list
of publications, and (iii) the name of two scientists who would agree to
send a letter of recommendation.

Review of the applications will start July 5 and the call will remain open
until the position is filled.
