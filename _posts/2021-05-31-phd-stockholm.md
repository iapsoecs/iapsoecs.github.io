We are pleased to announce a fully funded (normally 4 year) PhD studentship in physical oceanography and climate dynamics at the Bolin Centre for Climate Research and the Department of Geological Sciences at Stockholm University, with application deadline 24 June 2021.

The aim of the PhD project is to compare the ocean circulation during periods in the past and future in which global warming was driven by higher CO2 concentrations, solar radiation, or a different continental geography. Particular focus will be on what drives the Arctic Ocean circulation and sea-ice, and the deep circulation in the ocean, also called the Meridional Overturning Circulation. These aspects of the ocean circulation are inter-related and both have a large, but to a great extent unknown, impact on European climate. Time periods of specific interest are the so-called super interglacials of the past million years, including the Last Interglacial (~130-115 thousand years ago), as well as the Miocene (~23-5 million years ago). These warm periods are sometimes considered to be analogues for the future and we will investigate which lessons can be learned to better predict the behavior of the ocean circulation and its impact on climate in a future greenhouse world.

The selected candidate will perform climate simulations in the European climate model EC-Earth. In addition, they will make opportunistic use of available high-resolution EC-Earth simulations for the Last Interglacial and a suite of Miocene climate simulations. For those interested, there may be an opportunity to participate in an Arctic Ocean expedition.

Note that the studentship is officially advertised as a PhD in Marine Geology because the department does not have a program in physical oceanography or climate science. The main field of the project content will be ocean dynamics in the first instance and climate dynamics in the second instances. However, unlike many traditional projects in these fields, the focus will not be confined to the historic record of observations, since this is often too short to understand forcing, trends and variability of the large-scale ocean circulation and climate. As such we collaborate closely with paleoceanographers and geophysicists in the department and elsewhere to approach the problem from a cross-disciplinary angle.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.
