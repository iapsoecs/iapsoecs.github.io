Job advertised; 013621 - Post-Doctoral Researcher (contract until 30th November 2024),

Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Maynooth University
 
Maynooth University are seeking to recruit a post-doctoral researcher to work in Dr Niamh
Cahill’s research group. The candidate will work on a project titled “Predicting Sea Levels
and Sea Level Extremes for Ireland”. The project, which will run for 3 years, aims to exploit
existing methodologies for estimating current and future sea-level extremes and to expand upon
them in order to produce state-of-the-art, accessible software packages and a web-application
that will aid in the estimation and interpretation of the variability in Irish sea-levels and
sea-level extremes in the past, present and future.
 
The candidate is expected to develop statistical models that provide estimates and projections
of extreme sea levels (ESLs) considering the influences of mean sea-levels under different climate
scenarios. Model development will require the use of Bayesian methods, spatial methods, and extreme
value methods. The candidate will also contribute to the development of a user-friendly web-application,
interactive maps, R software and databases.
 
Salary: €39,132 per annum (1 point) with annual increments
 
The closing date for receipt of applications is 23:30hrs (local Irish time) on Sunday, 13th February 2022
