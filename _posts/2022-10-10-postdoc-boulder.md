We have an opening for a Postdoctoral Fellow in paleoclimate modeling at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could forward this to interested
candidates in your groups or networks.

The Postdoctoral Fellow will conduct original research on the Miocene
climate and carbon cycling. The Postdoctoral Fellow will develop new
simulations of the Miocene using the Community Earth System Model,
synthesize model results with published and newly developed proxy records
of sea-surface temperature, and test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms
for the Miocene global warming and carbon cycling.

This work is part of an NSF collaborative project that involves scientists
at Brown University (Dr. Weimin Si and Prof. Timothy Herbert). The work
will also contribute to the Miocene Model Intercomparison Project (MioMIP).
The Postdoctoral Fellow will have ample opportunities to interact with
interdisciplinary scientists within and outside NCAR.

Application Deadline: *October 21, 2022*. More information on the position
and application process can be found at:

Feel free to email Jiang Zhu (jiangzhu@ucar.edu) if you have any questions
about the position.
