We seek a talented and enthusiastic ocean scientist to join the vibrant Marine Systems Modelling group at NOC in Liverpool. The successful candidate will work on keeping our coastal-ocean modelling capability at the leading edge, through developing, testing and applying the NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) ocean model. Model developments will be motivated by and targeted towards improving our models of the NW European Shelf Seas, across a range of strategic research and operational oceanography projects, particularly in collaboration with the UK Met Office to support their operational forecast and reanalysis systems. She/he will be expected to develop their own scientific research direction in this context (e.g. in air-sea coupling, near coastal processes and/or turbulent mixing), publish in appropriate high-impact journals and seek grant income. She/he will be expected to collaborate widely in the UK and internationally and participate in the international NEMO consortium. We would look to the successful candidate to eventually take on a leading role in the context, managing a small portfolio of science project.

**About you**

The successful candidate will have experience in dynamical environmental modelling, preferably in the oceanographic context. In addition to being a dynamic research scientist, she/he will be an expert programmer, ideally in FORTRAN and highly familiar with high performance computing. Understanding of ocean, and particularly shelf sea physics, is highly desirable. She/he will have a Strong 1st degree in a numerate science, engineering or mathematics discipline and have achieved a PhD or have equivalent research experience in physical oceanography or other numerate environmental science.
