The Antipodal Oceanography Group (APOG) is searching for up to 3 postdoctoral
researchers to join efforts to understand polar change, emergent ecological
variability, and the impact of climate on health and infrastructure.


The researchers will join a broad cohort of oceanographers
(http://brownpog.com/), remote sensing specialists, and climate
scientists and fall broadly under polar oceanography, ecology, or human-climate
interaction. Areas of focus could include:

-      Modeling and observing waves across the oceans and sea ice using
high-resolution LES simulations and satellite products.


-      Developing ocean mixing parameterizations in polar regions using
high-resolution coupled discrete element modeling approaches.



-      Remote sensing and modeling of phytoplankton blooms in the wake of
tropical cyclones and under Antarctic sea ice.



-      Statistical and dynamical downscaling of Pacific climate variability
to understand climate impacts on health for Pacific islands.


-      Analysis of high-resolution climate model data and attribution of
climate extreme events using machine learning forecasts.



The APOG is a unique hybrid research group between Brown University and the
University of Auckland. Researchers can relocate to either center or remain
remote, with the expectation of at least two in-person meetings in New
Zealand or the US per year. Information on our shared code of conduct and
expectations can be found at polar-oceans.com/coc

A broad team, with project collaborators in Norway, France, the US, and New
Zealand, will support successful candidates. They will have leeway for
scientific exploration and self-directed research, especially within the
APOG cohort.

The position salary is $65,000 for two years, with the possibility of
extension. Start dates can be as early as 7/1/23, though flexibility
exists. Significant additional research, computing, and travel support are
available to facilitate this work.

Please direct any questions to Christopher Horvat: horvat@brown.edu

Applications (see below) can be sent to apog@brown.edu.

*Required Qualifications*

   - A Ph.D. in Earth/Climate Science/Applied Mathematics/related fields or
   relevant work experience in geospatial data analysis.
   - Experience analyzing/interpreting/manipulating geophysical and model
   data.
   - An open mind: interested in multi-scale climate or ecological
   modeling, polar climate, and climate-human interactions.

*Potentially positive skills/elements*

   - Knowledge of ocean mixing parameterizations and coupled air-sea-ice
   processes.
   - A theoretical background in submesoscale GFD problems
   - Experience with CESM or NEMO modeling frameworks
   - Usage of remote sensing platforms, e.g., ICESat-2, MODIS, Sentinel
   - Experience with machine learning or downscaling techniques applied to
   geophysical data.

*Application Instructions*

Please send a CV, a 1-page cover letter describing your research and future
interests, and contact information for three references to apog@brown.edu.
Please also include an example of research output (paper, thesis, technical
report, etc.) that illustrates your research approach and skill.

Any applications received before June 30 will be considered together, and
later applications will be considered as they arrive. Positions will remain
open until filled. When applying, please indicate research topics of
interest in your cover letter.
