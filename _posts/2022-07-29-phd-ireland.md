Applications are invited from suitably qualified candidates for a full-time PhD student to work on the Science Foundation Ireland iCRAG funded project MACMOMO (Mid-20th Century Atlantic Circulation informed by Modern Observations and Models). The PhD will revisit historical ship hydrographic observations of temperature and salinity and use these observations to estimate the mid-20th century Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. This research will be critical in informing our confidence in climate models ability to reproduce ocean circulation variability and in understanding 20th century climate.
