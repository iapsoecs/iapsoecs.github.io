A funded PhD student opportunity is available beginning Fall 2023 at the
University of California, Santa Barbara. The student will collaborate on
diagnosing the response of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to
climate change, through analysis of output from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). The student will also have the
opportunity to gain experience with running coupled climate simulations,
using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). This position is part
of a larger collaboration, and the student will work closely with current
PhD students and postdocs to be recruited in the 2022-23 academic year.
