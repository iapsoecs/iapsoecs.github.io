We are inviting applications for a Postdoctoral Researcher at NYU Courant and CDS, to join our team working on foundational models for multiscale multiphysics for climate models, as part of the international project, MÂ²LInES. The scientific goal of this project is to improve climate predictions by reducing climate model errors at the air-sea/ice interface using machine learning (ML).

The successful candidate will work with Profs Sara Shamekh and Laure Zanna, and with a team of interdisciplinary researchers to develop and implement ML for climate phenomena that span multiple scales and physics, in particular non-local boundary layer turbulence. 

The position, available immediately, is a full-time appointment, initially for one year, with the possibility of renewal for up to 3 years, subject to satisfactory performance and available funding.

Applications should be uploaded at: https://apply.interfolio.com/128045
