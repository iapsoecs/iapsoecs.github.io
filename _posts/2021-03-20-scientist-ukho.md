Being a Marine Scientist at the UK Hydrographic Office offers a career defining opportunity
to apply your scientific expertise across a range of marine environmental data (e.g. tidal,
marine biological, oceanographic, geological, acoustic and ocean climatological). Your
scientific input will support the development of world leading commercial, defence and
Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) products and services.

About UKHO

UKHO is an executive agency, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence. We work with a wide
range of data partners to chart the world's oceans in order to develop and serve world
leading software and data solutions to commercial shipping companies, navies and maritime
organisations. Our products ensure safe navigation and global trade efficiency and support
other marine activities including economic development, environmental protection,
resource exploration and utilisation, scientific research and security and defence.

The role

Our customers require professional advice and a range of situational awareness products
providing information about the marine environment to assist in their planning. To support
this, the Ocean Environment Team within the Scientific Analysis Group, acquires data from a
variety of sources and analyses this data for subsequent use.

The purpose of this post is to provide the expertise necessary to advise on the use of
environmental data and development to provide an assessment of the environmental
conditions likely to be encountered. This will be achieved through:
 Collaborations with NGO/scientific communities;
 Undertaking analysis of ocean environmental data to derive representative visualisations of the expected marine environmental conditions;
 Developing a good understanding of customer needs;
 Continuously reviewing methodology and working practices in order to provide a better service, more efficiently.

We are looking for a well‐connected and enthusiastic Marine Geologist and/or Underwater
Acoustician who is able to apply scientific concepts and advances to meet real world
customer needs. The ability to apply skills in data programming/data analysis to meet the
evolving needs of our customers is key to success in the role, as is a genuine desire to work
collaboratively as part of a small, dynamic team. Ideal attributes include the ability to
problem solve and work independently with a positive can‐do attitude.

To be successful in your application you will need to evidence the following essential
criteria:
 › Postgraduate qualification in marine geology/underwater acoustics including
experience of working within these fields (e.g. Marine Geology, Geophysics,
Underwater Acoustics).
 › Be confident in spatial data analysis as applied to marine environmental data,
including demonstrable experience of computer programming skills in either one or
more of the following: R, Python, Matlab, and are able to adapt to other
programming languages.
 › The ability to apply data presentation and visualisation techniques to marine
environmental data.
