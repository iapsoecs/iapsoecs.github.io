**Background**

The overall objective of the Helmholtz Young Investigator Group SOS-iClimate is to answer the question how melting Antarctic ice masses alter the ocean salinity and circulation and if these changes will amplify or dampen global warming in the future. For this purpose, we will identify and quantify the causes of past and future salinity changes in the Southern Ocean using ocean tracers, in particular seawater stable isotopes. These tracers serve as a fingerprint of impact of rapidly melting ice masses on the ocean’s salinity and we will use them to constrain climate model simulations.


**Tasks**

This position will use existing and newly collected measurements of the seawater stable isotopic composition from ship-board sample collection in the Southern Ocean to build a novel data base that can be used to trace the imprint of melting ice and changing surface moisture fluxes on the ocean. Through this effort, the position will contribute to the understanding of ongoing rapid changes in the Southern Ocean.

Specifically, this position will

 - search and identify existing data records of seawater stable isotopes from the Southern Ocean
 - inquire and record metadata
 - merge and reformat multiple data sets
 - assess data quality and quantify biases and uncertainties
 - coordinate and participate in international laboratory intercomparison studies
 - facilitate the collection and analysis of new observational data from the Southern Ocean
 - publish a statistical and technical assessment of the data set in peer-reviewed journal


**Requirements**

Ideally, you should hold a PhD degree related to Earth, climate, or environmental sciences. However, also applications of candidates that hold a MSc degree in a related field will be considered. We seek for a person with an extensive experience in data management and analysis, and organizational skills.

It is also expected to assist with project coordination and to interact with an interdisciplinary and international science community in order to build a network of data providers and users. Therefore, very good communication skills in English—both written and oral—are mandatory.


In addition, statistical and technical skills in acquiring and handling observational data is desirable.
