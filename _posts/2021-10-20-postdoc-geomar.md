The research units Marine Meteorology and Ocean Dynamics of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre Kiel, Kiel, Germany are offering a position as 

Postdoc (m/f/d) on high-resolution coupled modeling and storyline simulations
starting on January 1st, 2022 and extending to December 31st, 2024.

Job Description
The goal is to better understand and display the implications of accelerated melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet on European climate by means of storyline simulations using a climate model with an eddying North Atlantic. The position is part of the multi-institutional, innovative project SCENIC, an effort by a community of Helmholtz centres to study how extreme events would unfold in different climates, thereby complementing classical climate scenario methods. Focussing on Europe, SCENIC will tackle the following questions: Which processes determine extremes, and how will such processes change? What is the role of thermodynamic vs dynamic drivers of change? How do extremes unfold with major Greenland melting events or an Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation weakened by global warming?

Responsibilities
* Running numerical simulations with an established coupled global climate model
* Conducting original research using the model output
* Disseminating the research in international journals and conferences

Required qualification
* PhD in meteorology or oceanography or equivalent
* experience with climate models
* demonstrated experience in publishing
* proficiency in spoken and written English

Application Deadline
October 29th, 2021

The position is available for a funding period until December 31st 2024. The salary depends on qualification and could be up to the class 13 TVöD-Bund of the German tariff for public employees. This is a full-time position and the position can be split.

GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel seeks to increase the proportion of female scientists and explicitly encourages qualified female academics to apply.
GEOMAR is an equal opportunity employer and encourages scientists with disabilities to apply. Qualified disabled applicants will receive preference in the application process.

Please send your application for this post, containing CV, letter of motivation (1 page maximum), publication list, university degree/PhD certificate, and contact information for 2 references via email in a single pdf-file mentioning the keyword "SCENIC” in the subject line
to bewerbung(at)geomar.de not later than October 29th, 2021.

For further information regarding the position and research unit please contact Prof. Dr. Joakim Kjellsson (jkjellsson(at)geomar.de) and Dr. Torge Martin (tomartin(at)geomar.de).
