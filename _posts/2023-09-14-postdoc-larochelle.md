The laboratory

LIENSs is an Interdisciplinary Joint Research Unit part of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and La Rochelle University. LIENSs expertise spreads across environmental and social sciences addressing issues on the sustainability of the coastal domain exposed to global warming. The lab hosts about 80 researchers, 29 permanent engineers and technicians, 24 postdoctoral and invited researchers, and 40 PhD students.

Job description

We invite applications to work on a very high-resolution ocean-biogeochemical model encompassing the land-to-ocean interface. The postdoctoral researcher will work together with Vincent Le Fouest (LIENSs, France), Dimitris Menemenlis (NASA-JPL, USA), and Dustin Carroll (Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, USA) to 1) set up a regional cut-out of the ECCO-Darwin model (https://www.ecco-group.org) and 2) assess how terrigenous matter and sediment biogeochemistry alter air-sea CO2 fluxes in shallow systems. The project will focus on a semi-enclosed sea located in Bay of Biscay (Northeastern Atlantic) facing high anthropogenic pressure. The hired researcher will be involved in national and international research projects and interact with a large panel of specialists.
