The Hu Climate Dynamics Lab at Duke University is seeking 1 postdoctoral
associate to work on coupled climate dynamics. The main goal of the Hu lab
is to understand the role of air-sea coupling in global climate change and
variability by combining theory, observations, and climate modeling. In
this position, the postdoctoral associate will explore the physical
processes underlying extratropical air-sea interactions related to
climate/weather extremes (e.g., marine heatwaves, atmospheric rivers, etc.).

Please apply at https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/27448. Applications
will be reviewed immediately, but the position will remain open until
filled. For questions, please contact Prof. Shineng Hu at
shineng.hu@duke.edu.

TERM: This position will be awarded for 1 year and extended by 1 more year
contingent on satisfactory performance. There is also a possibility of
renewal for a third year.

QUALIFICATIONS: A PhD in climate dynamics, physical oceanography, or
atmospheric science is required. Modeling experience with general
circulation models, preferably CESM, is highly desirable.

PROJECTED START DATE: Fall 2024.

WORK LOCATION: Work takes place in Durham, NC
