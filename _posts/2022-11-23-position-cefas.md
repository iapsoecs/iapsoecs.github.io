Job Title: Ocean/Biogeochemical Modeller

Deadline: 19th December 2022

 

The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is the UK’s leading and most diverse centre for applied marine and freshwater science. We currently rank in the top 5% of over 2,500 international institutes publishing in the same fields. We advise government and private sector customers in the UK and abroad on the environmental impact of their policies, programmes and activities through our scientific evidence and impartial expert advice.

 

The successful applicant for this post will be involved in a range of modelling activities relevant to ocean and coastal processes, delivering quantitative applied marine science for a range of national and international customers. Examples include linking catchments to coastal water quality, effects of eutrophication, blue carbon management, and assessing combined human and climate impacts on marine ecosystems. You will work closely with a multi-disciplinary team, including oceanographers, biogeochemists, marine ecologists, and fisheries scientists, so strong communication and inter-personal skills are essential.

 

This role provides an exciting opportunity to learn and develop within a team of experienced hydrodynamic and biogeochemical modellers. We are seeking an enthusiastic and adaptable person, with a good knowledge of numerical modelling, including programming languages and data analysis methods. You will also have a desire to expand your knowledge of modelling techniques and broader marine science applications.
