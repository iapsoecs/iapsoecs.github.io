We are looking for a for a talented Physical Oceanography Modeller (Research Scientist) at the National Oceanography Centre, UK, (https://noc.ac.uk/) for a permanent position.

See details at:

https://careers.noc.ac.uk/vacancy/research-scientist-physical-oceanography-modeller-554353.html

Closing date: 31st May 2024

About the role

We seek a talented physical oceanographer with numerical modelling experience to join the vibrant Marine Systems Modelling group at NOC. You will develop and apply regional numerical ocean models to investigate the physical mechanisms that connect the deep and coastal oceans, and which drive change in coastal oceans. Initially the post will explore aspects of ocean circulation (e.g. tracer and volume transports) along the eastern boundary of the North Atlantic and sea level on the north-west European shelf, as part of the ODISSEA project (Climate consequences of rapid ocean change). You will collaborate internally and externally to apply your research to improving coastal and societal resilience via, for example, an improved interpretation of coastal vulnerability based on past, present and projected future ocean-climate variability. There is flexibility to work across several projects involving the development and application of high-resolution NEMO regional ocean models.
