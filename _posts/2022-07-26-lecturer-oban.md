Lecturer/Senior Lecturer in Benthic Biogeochemistry

Contract Type: Open-ended

Working Pattern: Full Time (37hrs per week)

Salary Range: Lecturer (£40,927-£46,042) S Lecturer (£50,296 - £56,587)

The Role:

You will be a key player in driving forward SAMS programme of discovery and applied research in the area of marine benthic biogeochemistry/benthic processes.
You will be expected to engage with both existing SAMS research and commercial projects, but also develop your own funding streams over time and to contribute to SAMS programme of education at undergraduate and post-graduate levels.
You will use your experience in the design and application of laboratory/field experimentation, working with mathematical modellers, and/or using your own experience in numerical model development, to implement your findings into real-world applications, particularly in relation to aquaculture and its potential environmental impacts. Contributing, for example, biogeochemical understanding to the further development of marine aquaculture impact models such as “New DEPOMOD”.

Our Ideal Candidate:

You will have a PhD in marine biogeochemistry/benthic processes.

The successful candidate will have experience in at least one of the following areas: benthic impacts of marine aquaculture, benthic biogeochemical processes including impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbance, interactions between benthic biogeochemistry and benthic ecology, benthic-pelagic coupling and impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbance.
Experience in or understanding of numerical modelling is also desirable.

This position would be an ideal opportunity for a candidate with interest in or, experience of, working with the aquaculture industry.
