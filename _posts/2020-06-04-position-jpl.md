Job Title: Technologist II, Ocean Altimetry Missions
Location: Pasadena, CA

Responsibilities:
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory based in Pasadena, CA invites application for a Research Technologist to provide support to Ocean Altimetry missions with a focus on the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission by working under the guidance of the SWOT Project Scientist to solve mission-related scientific problems through data analysis, ocean modeling, and data assimilation. The successful candidate will:

  *   develop methodology for producing high-level data products of ocean surface dynamic topography from the combination of conventional altimetry with the SWOT mission;
  *   work within a team of researchers to utilize data assimilation systems for estimating the state of the ocean from SWOT and other complementary observations, in particular, leading the analysis of data from the constellation of conventional altimeters in providing the large-scale background for synthesizing the small-scale information from SWOT;
  *   play some leadership roles in coordination of the in-situ campaigns of SWOT cal/val;
  *   participate in the processing and management of the SWOT ocean cal/val in-situ data;
  *   publish results of related scientific analysis in peer-reviewed journals.

Required Qualifications:


  *   PhD in Oceanography, Earth Sciences, or related scientific discipline
  *   Demonstrated expertise in studying mesoscale and submesoscale ocean variability, especially from satellite altimetry data, as evidenced by a publication record in peer reviewed journals.
  *   Excellent oral and written communications skills.

Preferred Qualifications

  *   Minimum of two years of related experience beyond PhD.
  *   Demonstrated experience of using in-situ measurements for studying mesoscale and submesoscale ocean variability that are synergistic with satellite measurements.
  *   Demonstrated experience in organizing oceanographic field experiments.
  *   Demonstrated experience of managing research projects as a Principal Investigator.


Complete applications will include a cover letter describing the applicant's vision for their role at JPL as a leader and contributor in supporting the SWOT mission, a curriculum vitae including a bibliography of refereed and other work, a statement on research experience, and research objectives, and contact information for at least three professional references.
