The Integrative Oceanography Division at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) at UC San Diego is seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher for the Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) under the supervision of Dr Eric Terrill and Dr Sophia Merrifield.

We invite applications for a postdoctoral researcher to study the physics of ocean surface wave processes, wave statistics, forecasting, observational methods, hindcast trend analysis; or some combination of these sub disciplines.  The applicant will be expected to use modeling tools and observational datasets, primarily in support of collaborative work with the US Army Corps of Engineers. The successful applicant will have skills in oceanography, wave physics, data analysis, ocean wave modeling (e.g. WaveWatchIII), and signal processing.

The postdoc will be located at SIO in La Jolla, CA and work with Sophia Merrifield, Eric Terrill, Peter Rogowski, James Behrens, graduate students and other scientific staff at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Experience in one or more of the following is desired: ocean wave modeling and validation, time series analysis and signal processing, scientific programming, and ocean wave sensing.

The project specifics will depend on the skillset and interests of the successful applicant. Available topics include wave-current interactions, wave attenuation in ice, air-sea interaction, changing wave climate, wave transformation, storm waves and extreme seas, ocean data assimilation into wave forecast models.

Minimum Background:

1. A PhD in physical oceanography or other relevant field in science, engineering, or mathematics.
2. Research experience in a relevant field with contributions to refereed journal articles.
3. Ability to pursue research both independently and collaboratively
4. Programming experience

Must be U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident

Initial appointment will be for 12 months, renewable for a second year, subject to performance and availability of funding.  Salary commensurate with qualifications and experience.  This is not a tenure-track position.  Position can begin as soon as July 2020, and ideally no later than October 2020.  Additional information can be found at https://postdoc.ucsd.edu

To apply: email postdoc@cdip.ucsd.edu<mailto:postdoc@cdip.ucsd.edu> a SINGLE PDF with a cover letter, CV, and contact information for 3 references with the subject: ?CDIP postdoc position?.
