The project is part of a large German collaborative research center on
energy transfers in atmosphere and ocean
(https://www.trr-energytransfers.de/). Our project develops novel
concepts for reducing spurious numerical mixing in ocean models and
investigates its impacts on the energetic consistency of the models.
