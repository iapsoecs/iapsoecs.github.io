The Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde (IOW) offers
tenure-track scientist positions in a new research unit, which aims at
understanding the role of the shallow-water, near-coastal zone for the
Baltic Sea system.
This position for a biogeochemical modeller is about extending an existing
ecosystem model (ERGOM) to simulate shallow-water regions and their
interactions with the open sea.

The full-time position (part-time work is possible) is limited to 3 years
initially, but is intended to become permanent in case of a positive
scientific evaluation of the candidate. Please apply until March 29th!

Our interdisciplinary institute is located directly at the beach in
Warnemünde, a popular seaside resort which belongs to the city of Rostock
(200.000 inhabitants). Rostock with its university is a lively city and
offers a lot of free-time possibilities and still quite affordable housing.
A direct train takes 2 hours to Berlin and 2.5 hours to its new airport.
