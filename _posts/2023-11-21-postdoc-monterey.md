There is an opportunity for a postdoctoral scholar within the Department of Meteorology at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. The work will focus on using experimental data to study the physical role ocean waves play in the dynamics of the air-sea interface. Future research will focus on analyzing micrometeorological and oceanographic data collected during major field studies, such as the CASPER (https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/99/7/bams-d-16-0046.1.xml) and CLASI (clasidri.weebly.com) projects. Specific avenues of inquiry will be discussed and there will be leeway for self-directed research study.


Ideal applicants will hold a doctorate in a field related to ocean/atmosphere science, physics, mechanics, applied mathematics, etc. They will be self-motivated and have a strong background in experimental data analysis. Applicants with a numerical modeling background in this topic, and who are interested in doing model-observation studies, are encouraged to apply. 

As part of this position, there will be opportunities for travel, field work, and collaboration with other institutions.
