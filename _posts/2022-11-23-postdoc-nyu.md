We seek to fill a postdoctoral position at NYU Courant
(https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) and CDS (https://cds.nyu.edu/), as part of
M2LInES (https://m2lines.github.io/) (Multiscale Machine Learning In
Coupled Earth System Modeling). This is an international effort to further
our understanding of the climate system and improve climate models with
scientific machine learning by reducing biases at the air-sea
interface. M?LInES includes climate scientists, numerical modelers, and
machine learning experts at NYU, Princeton, Columbia, MIT, Lamont, GFDL,
NCAR, IPSL, IGE.

The postdoctoral associate will focus on improving our understanding of
ocean processes which influence global climate, in particular patterns of
sea surface temperatures and heat uptake. The project will focus on using
methods such as equation discovery to learn new physics and develop subgrid
parameterizations of ocean processes (e.g., Zanna & Bolton, 2020: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL088376;
or Ross et al., 2022: https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10511742.2) to
ensure interpretability, and easy implementation in global models. The
postdoctoral researcher will work under the supervision of Prof Laure Zanna
(https://laurezanna.github.io/) and is expected to collaborate with other
members of M2LInES.

Further information about equation-discovery for physics is discussed in a
recent Quanta article
(https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-scientists-distill-the-laws-of-physics-from-raw-data-20220510/),
details about machine learning for multiscale ocean processes are outlined
in a SIAM news article
(https://dhruvbalwada.github.io/assets/documents/Balwada&Zanna2022.pdf),
and a description of M2LInES goals and members can be found on our website
(https://m2lines.github.io/).

The position, available immediately, is a full-time appointment, initially
for one year, with the possibility of renewal for up to three years,
subject to satisfactory performance and available funding.
