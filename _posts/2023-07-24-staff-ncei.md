The Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado in Boulder has an opening for an experienced marine geophysical data manager working with the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Team at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The candidate for this position will lead the operational ingest and archive of marine geophysical data, managing data to meet the Open Archival Information Standards (OAIS). The focus for this position includes ensuring the data integrity, security, and maintenance processes for managing marine underway geophysical data, including single beam bathymetry, sub-bottom profiler, side scan sonar, magnetic, gravity, and navigation data. This effort directly supports the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act and the Memorandum on Ocean Mapping of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone and the Shoreline and Nearshore of Alaska.

CIRES conducts collaborative research with NOAA on the archive, analysis and processing of data that describe the seafloor and subsurface. This includes ingesting consistent, quality controlled data sets, applying analytical tools to assess and monitor changes in the coasts and oceans, and supporting informed decision-making and aiding in the understanding of coastal and ocean conditions and their impact on the environment, economies, and societies. This position is co-located with staff at NCEI, David Skaggs Research Center, 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado, and supports the CIRES Research Theme of Advance Modeling and Observing Systems. NCEI is a part of the US Department of Commerce (US DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS).
