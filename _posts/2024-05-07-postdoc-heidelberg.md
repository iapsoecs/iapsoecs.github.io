I would greatly appreciate if you could distribute this 12 months
postdoc position among potential candidates. The main task of the
postdoc would be mainly to interpret and publish newly generated proxy
data from the equatorial Pacific in relation to ENSO variability. The
position would be ideal for someone with a fresh PhD with a
paleoceanographic background and experience with ENSO dynamics.
Application deadline is 31 May. 

**Postdoctoral position in Paleoceanography / Paleoclimatology**

(12 months, full-time)

The project is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and aims to decipher the
spatial and temporal dynamics of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), especially with
regard to the influence of future global warming scenarios, characterized by elevated
greenhouse gas concentrations and reduced continental ice volumes. For this purpose, the
applicant will interpret proxy-based marine sea surface temperature records from Equatorial
Pacific drill cores, covering the mid-to-late Pleistocene as well as early Pliocene. Publication
of the results in international, peer-reviewed journals is expected as well as participation in
conferences and workshops.

Requirements for applicants are completion of a PhD in geosciences or a closely related
discipline prior to appointment, and written and spoken fluency in English. The successful
candidate should further have a strong background in paleoceanography and
paleoclimatology. Experience in numerical modeling would be a beneficial asset. The
appointment is for 12 months with salary and social security benefits according to a German
civil service position (100% E13).

The Institute of Earth Sciences at Heidelberg University offers a thriving environment with
state-of-the art analytical facilities and a strong reputation in geoscience research.
Heidelberg University is further committed to increasing the proportion of female scientific
staff, and applications from women are especially welcome. Disabled persons will be given
preference if equally qualified.

Applications (including a CV, a 1-2 page cover letter and the contact information of two
referees familiar with the applicant’s research) should be sent as a single pdf file to Dr. André
Bahr (E-mail: andre.bahr@geow.uni-heidelberg.de). The closing date for applications is 31st
May 2024. Potential starting date is 1st September 2024.

For additional information please contact Dr. André Bahr (Institute of Earth Sciences,
University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 234, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; E-mail:
andre.bahr@geow.uni-heidelberg.de).
