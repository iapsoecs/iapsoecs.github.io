I'm excited to announce several positions as part of my new research group ('Southern Ocean & Antarctic Sea ice Evolution', or SO-ASE) based in the Climate Dynamics section at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany.

The group aims to tease apart the physical processes that have driven the surprising behaviour of Antarctic sea ice, and develop understanding of how the broader Southern Ocean climate system will change in the future.

The deadline for applications is Dec 31st 2024, and more details on the positions are available at the links below:

Best wishes,
