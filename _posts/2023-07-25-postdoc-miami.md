We are recruiting a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Miami to work on a project on the role of upper ocean processes in changes in climate on multi-decadal timescales.  The successful applicant will work with Dr. Amy Clement and a dynamic team of students, scientists, and faculty to develop a hierarchy of models to test how ocean circulation modifies the signature of anthropogenic climate change. Anticipated duties include development of ocean elements of a climate model hierarchy, analysis of observational data and climate model output, and communication of findings in written and oral form. 

Desired qualifications include a Ph.D. in ocean or atmospheric science, strong quantitative and programming skills, experience with running the Community Earth System Model or other atmosphere or ocean general circulation models, and strong oral and written communication skills. The salary will be competitive and commensurate with relevant experience. We particularly encourage applications from women, minorities, and other groups that are historically underrepresented in the Geosciences. This appointment is for one year and subject to extension pending funding availability.
