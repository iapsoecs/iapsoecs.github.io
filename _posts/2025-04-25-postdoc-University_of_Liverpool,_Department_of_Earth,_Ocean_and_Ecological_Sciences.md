This role is an exciting opportunity to work on the interplay between biology and physics on ocean carbon sequestration by the Biological Carbon Pump.

You will work on quantifying the Biological Carbon Pump in future projections made by IPCC-class Earth System Models. You will identify, extract and analyse a broad suite of Biological Pump outputs and metrics from existing model outputs (CMIP6) allowing you to make a state-of-the-art and comprehensive assessment of how and why the future Biological Carbon Pump and is expected to change in the future. You will also collaborate with project partners to help build a repository of these outputs that is aligned with other observation-based repositories for the Biological Carbon Pump.

Prior experience with Earth System Modelling is beneficial but applicants with a strong background and ocean biogeochemistry. Prior experience with Earth System Model outputs is beneficial but applicants with an interest in developing or diversifying into this area are also welcomed to apply.

The role is part of the PRECOG  project, a newly funded UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship which aims to quantify how and why carbon sequestration in the ocean from the Biological Carbon Pump will change in a future changing climate and the impact this has on the wider carbon cycle. You will also be a part of the Ocean Sciences  research group at Liverpool, which is a dynamic group working across ocean physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology using a range of modelling and observational-experimental approaches.

You will work closely with Dr Jamie Wilson   and a second postdoctoral researcher specialising in quantifying the Biological Carbon Pump in existing IPCC projections and a PhD researcher. You will also spend time visiting the project partners institutes for short periods of time. PRECOG has collaborations with the National Oceanography Centre; University of East Anglia; University of York; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace  (France); AXA Research Fund; and the international research network JETZON.

You will also be part of the Department of Earth Oceans and Ecological Science,  and wider University. We provide a strongly supportive environment for postdoctoral researchers and the university is a signatory to the Researcher Development Concordat, and provides networking and development opportunities through the successful Prosper portal.

The post is available from 1st June 2025 until 31st July 2028.

If you are still awaiting your PhD to be awarded you will be appointed at Grade 6, spine point 30. Upon written confirmation that you have been awarded your PhD, your salary will be increased to Grade 7, spine point 31.

This role is eligible for sponsorship under the skilled worker route.
