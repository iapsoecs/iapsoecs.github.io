**Job Summary**

We seek a Research Associate to join the project “Sources, Sinks and Sustainable Solutions for Impacts of Plastic on Coastal Communities in Vietnam”. This GCRF funded £2.8m project will work closely with partners in Vietnam. We’re hiring four postdocs; this one will be for a highly motivated person specialising in the engagement and communication of environmental issues. The position will design and action novel engagement practices between project academics, project partners and local-to-(inter)national stakeholders to pioneer new solutions to the ‘plastic challenge’. This multi-faceted strategy will combine cross-sector dialogue to identify plastic-use barriers, triggers for low-plastic behaviours and to stimulate manufacturing and waste management innovations to mitigate plastic risk.
The capacity building and communication (CBC) program will act as the central hub of the 3SIP2C project, connecting and communicating outcomes of the research, internally and externally. CBC will interlink all other work packages, study regions and stakeholders along Vietnam’s coastline through the instigation of a ‘No-Plastic’ network that transcends the business, education and public sectors. Further details at https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/research/global/lyell-centre/impacts-plastics-vietnam.htm
The position requires significant fieldwork and as such you must be able to work independently, have strong organisational and communication skills, and thrive in seeking solutions to a variety of challenges, including in complicated and partly remote environments. We encourage disclosure of special needs to enable us to make reasonable adjustments to support you. You will work effectively as part of a larger team including other PDRAs, technicians, and PhD researchers.
The contract will be open-ended but with fixed funding until 31 December 2024. Hours will be 35/week but with flexibility due to fieldwork.

**Key Duties & Responsibilities**

Based on the strengths and experience of the successful candidate, the position will take selected responsibilities in four interconnected clusters of activity that jointly feed into an integrated portfolio of solutions.
- Workshops & discussion forums
- Stakeholder & Public Engagement
- Multi-directional exchanges
- Co-design of solutions

You will have a PhD in a relevant area in engagement, communications, environmental sciences or related subject; a strong academic publication record or equivalent portfolio; experience in civil society engagement in research and policy relevant projects, designed to deliver solution-based impacts; practical experience in design, leadership and delivery of engagement strategies that connect local communities with stakeholders; competence with a wide range of engagement techniques, connecting local community, government and international, educational and business sectors.
