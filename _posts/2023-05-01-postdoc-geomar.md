Position should start on July 1st, 2023 or soon thereafter, for a 3.5-year period.

**Job Description**

The position is part of the EU-HORIZON project “Strategies for the evaluation and assessment of ocean based carbon dioxide removal” (SEAO2-CDR). The FOCI (Flexible Ocean and Climate Infrastructure) model run at GEOMAR will be employed to simulate and evaluate various deployment scenarios of different marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods with respect to carbon removal. Observing system simulation experiments will be carried out to inform the development of observing strategies in related work packages of the project. Analysis of the model simulations and refinement of simulated deployment and measurement strategies will inform the development of appropriate measurement and accounting methodologies for different marine CDR methods.

The successful candidate will collaborate with other members of the Marine Biogeochemical Modelling research unit and, whenever applicable, other scientists at GEOMAR, Kiel University, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and other partners of the SEAO2-CDR project. The research unit offers a vibrant research environment with scientists working on a wide range of research questions, including the understanding of global change impacts, the assessment of mitigation approaches, dynamics of deoxygenation, the interface of ecology and biogeochemistry, and applications of data assimilation, machine-learning and uncertainty-analysis methods.

**Qualification**

We are looking for a creative and committed scientist with a MSc degree in a natural sciences subject, a strong interest in the global carbon cycle and marine biogeochemistry, and demonstrated experience with biogeochemical ocean or Earth system modelling. Experience in working as part of an interdisciplinary and diverse team would be helpful. The working language is English.

**Our offer**

At a workplace, directly on the Kiel Fjord with many leisure and recreational opportunities, we offer you:

    Good conditions for work-life balance: We offer, among other things, the possibility of mobile working and individual working time arrangements, vacation courses for the children of our employees, and good support in finding a place in a daycare center at the Kiel site
    Support services for professional and personal life situations
    An exciting work environment with the opportunity to provide important impetus for the development of sustainable solutions
    Exciting topics in an international environment
    Work in the field of marine and climate research, a forward-looking area with social significance
    30 vacation days + additional time off at Christmas and New Year's Eve
    Company pension plan and capital-forming benefits

The position is limited to 3.5 years.

The salary depends on qualification and could be up to the class 13 TVöD-Bund of the German tariff for public employees. This is a full-time position and there is the possibility to split it.
