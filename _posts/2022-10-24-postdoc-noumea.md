**The CLIPSSA 2021-2024 project**

CLIPSSA (Pacific climate, local knowledge and adaptation strategies) is a joint regional project developed
by IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, https://en.ird.fr/), Météo-France (the French
Meteorological Service) and AFD (Agence Française de Développement: https://www.afd.fr/en). It aims at
accompanying Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Wallis-and-Futuna and French Polynesia, in drafting adaptation
plans against climate change threats.

First, the project aims at building reliable estimates of the South Pacific regional future climates, at scales
ranging from those of the South Pacific Convergence Zone to synoptic scales (e.g. tropical cyclones).
Second, it aims at better understanding the fate of local climates and extremes for the targeted countries.
Third, the project aims at providing key information on a few climate-related sectorial impacts as prioritized
by Vanuatu and the French territories. These three aspects are all necessary steps towards a better
appropriation of the future of the South Pacific climates and societal impacts by the population and local
authorities, in support of their national/local adaptation plans. This proposed 2-year postdoc position targets
the second objective of CLIPSSA: “a better understanding of the local climates and extremes in the New-
Caledonia/Vanuatu region”.

**Scientific background of the opened position.**

The South Pacific is made of a myriad of islands. Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) are highly
vulnerable to the effects of climate variability and longer-term changes. Even more than developed
countries, these islands are highly vulnerable to the amount of precipitation that will dictate their water
resources and they are deeply affected by a number of meteorological events ranging from extreme events
(e.g. cyclones, heat waves, heavy rains etc.) to the impacts of large-scale phenomena such as ENSO (El
Niño Southern Oscillation). All of these can cause major social, economic and ecological damage on land
and in lagoons and on their ecosystems as many of the island countries' resources depend on their coral
ecosystems.

At present, IPCC models do not possess the spatial resolution that can resolve the appropriate scales
needed in the case of the many Pacific Island countries, which are mountainous such as New Caledonia
and the Vanuatu archipelagoes. For instance, previous studies in New Caledonia have shown that even at
20km scales, the main climatological atmospheric features are badly captured (Dutheil et al., 2020). This
not only suggests that knowledge provided by IPCC models are irrelevant at these scales but also that the
future of extremes events that deeply affect these islands cannot be assessed. Therefore, we lack at
present the key information to understand what may be the future climates of such islands in general and
therefore their impacts on sectorial activities. That in turn prevents public bodies to include the climate
change risks in their long-term environmental policies and in particular in the many adaptation plans that
are currently developed in these countries to face climate change.

The first challenge is thus to be able to provide pertinent and robust information about the many possible
future climates at island scales and the associated uncertainties that emerge from the IPCC scenarii and
models. The CLIPSSA project offers a 2-year postdoc position starting in early 2023 to downscale the
climate information from the IPCC model futures to provide:

• Local-scale dynamical downscaling of CMIP6 models in the New-Caledonia/Vanuatu region for the
next 100 years in SSP scenarii such as 126, 245, 370, 585 using the atmospheric model AROME
(e.g Fumière et al., 2020)
• Analyze the fate of the local climates in terms of seasonal and interannual variability (e.g ENSO)
and extremes such as heat waves, rainfall, droughts.
• Give insights on how the numerous uncertainties (e.g., boundary conditions from climate models,
internal variability, model parameterizations etc.) impact the previous atmospheric features.

The local atmospheric modeling will be developed in synergy with ongoing studies in CLIPSSA on similar
questions at the South Pacific scale (20km) using ALADIN and in the French Polynesia region using
AROME. The postdoc will collaborate with the human&social science team of CLIPSSA who is studying
how local knowledge can be mobilized and integrated in the country adaptation plans and also with the
public authorities which define the sectors where the impact models will be developed.

**Working conditions and financial conditions**

The candidate will be hired by IRD and will spend part of its time at Météo-France, Toulouse, France where
the simulations will be produced. He/she will also spend time at IRD and Météo-France in New
Caledonia/Vanuatu/French Polynesia with the project partners. The salary will range between 2,500 and
3,400€ before tax deduction, depending on the candidate experience. Travels between partners and
countries are provided as well as participations to key national and international conferences.

**Candidate requirements and applications**

The candidate should have a good knowledge of spoken and written English. The candidate should have a
PhD in climate sciences, preferentially in atmospheric sciences. Experience with regional climate modeling
and climate issues and models is appreciated. Candidates are expected to send a detailed CV as well as a
motivation letter emphasizing the work aspects that he/she would like to particularly develop within the
modeling framework described above. Those should be sent before December 15 th 2022 to:
fleur.vallet@ird.fr, christophe.menkes@ird.fr, matthieu.lengaigne@ird.fr, jerome.vialard@ird.fr,
alexandre.peltier@meteo.fr, agathe.drouin@meteo.fr, lola.corre@meteo.fr , cyril.dutheil@io-
warnemuende.de

The position will ideally start early 2023 in Toulouse, France.
