Scientific Description : 

Deoxygenation is a critical consequence of climate and ocean global changes and a main current concern among the scientific community. Global warming limits the oxygen solubility and increases stratification which reduces ocean mixing and circulation. The resulting reduced supply of atmospheric oxygen into the deep ocean has strong implications in ocean productivity, biogeochemical cycles, and marine habitats.
The North Atlantic is a key region for intermediate and deep water formation and transformation due to the vigorous winter convection. The formation and subsequent subduction and distribution of oxygen-rich waters embedded in the North Atlantic water mass circulation are important processes for the ocean ventilation with a broad impact on local and global ecosystem.
One of the novelties of the project, is the use of the new quality-controlled O2-Argo dataset in North Atlantic. In the past decade unprecedented efforts were made to enhance the oxygen measurements database at both national and international level as part of the international Argo program.
Using all the available O2 observations, the scientific question that we aim to address with this project is about (i) the spatial and temporal change of the dissolved oxygen in the North Atlantic and its driving mechanisms. Specifically, we will focus on (ii) the oxygen solubility in the mixed layer, (iii) the subduction and subsequent spreading in the ocean interior associated with circulation and water mass transformations (mixing), and (iv) the biological consumption and diffusion as processes based on the variability of the oxygen concentration. The privileged approach will be the use of available O2 measurements in the North Atlantic, but conjoint model approach is welcome.

This project is funded by the French SAD Brittany Regional post-doctoral grant program. The conditions of eligibility of the candidate are:
- PhD. in physical oceanography or related field
- Candidate should have spent at least 18 months out of France since 1st May 2016
- Position should start any time before 1st December 2020
- Applicants should send a CV with two recommendation letters to nicolas.kolodziejczyk@univ-brest.fr
