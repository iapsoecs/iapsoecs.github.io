A two-year postdoc position on the influence of waves on oil spills in the upper ocean
is now open at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway). The postdoc is
funded through the ENTIRE project (Research Council of Norway, NFR) and allows
a possible extension of up to one year. It is a requirement that the candidate shall not
previously have completed a postdoc funded through NFR.

MET Norway forecasts weather, monitors the climate and conducts research. Since
the institute was established in 1866, Norwegian meteorologists have figured
prominently in the development of the discipline.

Our main goal is to help protect life and property. To achieve this we run a suite of
forecast models for the atmosphere, the ocean and the oceanic wave field as well as
a number of downstream services based on these forecasts. One such important
downstream service is the modelling of the drift and fate of oil spilled in the ocean.
This includes modelling the entrainment of surface oil into the ocean due to breaking
waves, with associated turbulent mixing, counteracting the buoyancy depending on
the resulting oil droplet radii. This is a complex problem which requires both
analytical, numerical and experimental effort in order to make progress.

**Responsibility**

The successful applicant will contribute to our increased understanding of the
entrainment problem, and implement parameterisations of this into an oil spill model
used operationally at MET Norway.

The work consists of several sub-tasks:
- collect and compare existing parameterisations of whitecapping based on output from operational wave models
- compare these parameterisations with:
- in situ measurements, e.g., from stereo cameras mounted on a platform at the Ekofisk oil field
- output from the Breaking Wave Analysis (BWA) CFD model
- test if other output parameters from wave models (e.g., the dissipation rate) can improve the parameterisations
- perform oil drift simulations based on output from a high resolution hydrodynamic model
- measurements of submerged bubbles from the LoVe observatory
echosounder data may also be used to study the entrainment and subsequent
vertical turbulent mixing.
- contribute to the planning and conduction of relevant field measurements
during future oil-on-water exercises in the North Sea

The candidate may pay shorter visits to the SINTEF laboratory in Trondheim, where
complementary wave tank studies of oil entrainment will be conducted. Scientific
stays with other project partners will also be possible.

The work place will be Bergen in the Division for Marine Meteorology and
Operational Oceanography, and the preferred start date is 1 August 2022.

Qualifications
● PhD in meteorology, oceanography, physics, applied mathematics, or
computer science
● Documented skill in scientific programming, particularly Python

qualifications and experience (NOK 468,300 – 604,500 per year). A higher
salary can be negotiated in case the selected applicant has excellent
qualifications and extensive work experience
● Membership in the governmental pension fund, SPK (2% deducted from gross
salary), one of the best pension funds in Norway
● Insurances and mortgage through SPK
● A pleasant working environment

We emphasize diversity and therefore encourage all those who are qualified to apply
- regardless of age, gender, functional capacity, ethnic background or gaps in the
resume. The Norwegian government invites a joint effort for inclusion and has set the
target that 5% of all new government employees should have impaired functional
capacity or gaps in their resumes. The working conditions will be facilitated for
employees with disabilities. Applicants who inform that they have reduced functional
capacity will be invited to an interview if they are qualified.

If in any case an applicant does not wish to be registered on the public application
list, the applicant will need to give a reasonably argued justification. Information
about the applicant can still be published. If the wish to not be registered on the
public application list is denied, the applicant will be informed prior to the disclosure.
