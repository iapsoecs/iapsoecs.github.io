Position description
The Department of Marine Physical Laboratory Division (MPL) within the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego is committed to academic excellence and diversity within the faculty, staff and student body, and invites applications from qualified individuals for an Assistant Project Scientist for an open search.

The candidate is responsible for effectively working within a research team and collaborating with colleagues outside UCSD while demonstrating the capacity to work autonomously. The candidate's responsibility involves large data set analysis, numerical modeling, field work experiments, and guiding students and postdocs within the group. At UC San Diego, Assistant Project Scientists are academic researchers who are expected to make significant and creative contributions to a research team, but may not necessarily be a leader of a research team. They are not required to carry out independent research or develop an independent research reputation, but will publish and carry out research under the supervision of a member of the Professor or Professional Research series. Focused areas of research include Ocean Acoustics, Acoustical Oceanography, Modeling and State Estimation of the Oceans, and Ocean Instrumentation and Technology.

All positions are subject to availability of funding.

Salary is commensurate with qualifications and based on University of California pay scales.

Review of applications will continue until the position is filled based on the on-going needs of the Marine Physical Laboratory Division.
