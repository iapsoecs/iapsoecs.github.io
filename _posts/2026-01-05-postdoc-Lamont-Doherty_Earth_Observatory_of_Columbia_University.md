## Description

The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Scientist position in the McKinley Ocean Carbon Group.

Air-sea CO2 and O2 exchange is vigorous and particularly critical to climate and ocean life in the high North Atlantic. This is one of only a few places where deep-water formation occurs, moving waters rich in anthropogenic CO2 and O2 to the abyss, where they are sequestered for hundreds to thousands of years. Numerical simulations are essential scientific tools for understanding the interplay between short-term gas exchange and the long-term evolution of whole-ocean CO2 and O2 content. The McKinley Group has developed a state-of-the-art regional ocean simulation that applies data assimilation to optimize biogeochemical processes (ASTE-BGC) (Moseley et al. JAMES, in review). This postdoc will integrate bubble-mediated flux parameterization codes into the optimized ASTE-BGC,  run ASTE-BGC, analyze impacts of these parameterizations on CO2 and O2 fluxes and budgets, and publish results.

 
## Qualifications

Candidates should have completed or be nearing completion of a Ph.D. in ocean and climate science and have experience running numerical models in Fortran. Excellent communication, interpersonal, and organizational skills, and the ability to use independent judgement required. Evidence of the ability to conduct and publish high-quality research is required. 

The search will remain open for at least 30 days after the ad appears and will continue until the position is filled. Proposed start date is March 1, 2026, with some flexibility. 

The initial appointment will be for 1 year with continuation pending funding and progress.

Columbia University benefits accompany this Officer of Research appointment.
