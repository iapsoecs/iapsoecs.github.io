I am pleased to announce that NOAA/GFDL has opened a position for a Federal research scientist to work on sea level. This is a term hire position to explore processes giving rise to regional sea level and extremes along the US East Coast.  The position will have a particular emphasis working with high-resolution and regional configurations of MOM6 for the Northwest Atlantic domain. Officially the job title for this position is Physical Scientist, but someone with a background in physical oceanography or numerical methods for modeling geophysical systems and experience in oceanography or research related to sea level would be the ideal candidate. NOAA/GFDL is a national laboratory that carries out long-term research that is relevant to NOAA's mission, in this case related to sea level science.
