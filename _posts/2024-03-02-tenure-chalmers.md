We are excited to announce that Chalmers University of Technology in
Gothenburg, Sweden has issued a university-wide call for up to 7
tenure-track positions for the role of Assistant Professor in Basic
Science. Additionally, there is one tenure-track Assistant Professor
position opening in the thematic area of Space technology, and a similar
opening in Ocean.

We at the Division of Geoscience and Remote Sensing (GEO), within the
Department of Space, Earth and Environment (SEE), welcome candidates who
work broadly in Earth and climate science to apply. The division conducts
research, education and utilization within a wide range of scientific and
engineering disciplines to advance our understanding of the Earth system
and global environmental issues. We have a broad expertise in different
remote sensing technologies and are actively involved in several satellite
missions, but also work with ground-based measurements, numerical modeling,
data analysis, modelâ€“data fusion, and machine learning algorithms. You can
find more information on our website:

To qualify for the position, you must have obtained your PhD within 7 years
of the application deadline (with possible extensions due to parental
leave, sick leave, and military service). The deadline for the application
is 2024-03-15 CET.
