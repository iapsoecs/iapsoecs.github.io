Multiple PhD opportunities are available within the Climate and Fluid
Physics group at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.
Example projects with *top-up scholarships* available include:

   - Computational modelling of ocean heat transport towards Antarctica,
   - Laboratory studies including on internal wave-eddy interactions and
   the energy balance at the sea surface.

Other projects in line with the groupâ€™s broad research interests are also
possible (from large-scale ocean circulation to internal waves, turbulence
and ocean model development).

We seek expressions of interest from graduates with a strong background in
physics, mathematics, engineering, dynamical oceanography or similar
quantitative sciences. Full details of projects and how to apply here:

Expressions of interest due by **31st of July 2020**.
