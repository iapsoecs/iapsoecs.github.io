The School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences invites applications for a
tenure-track Associate Professor position in the area of Marine Ecological
Modeling. We seek to build this expertise base to better understand
processes affecting animal movement, distribution, and ecosystem dynamics
from physical, biogeochemical, biotic, and anthropogenic drivers. We are
especially interested in quantitative population, community, and ecosystem
level dynamics focused on fish, mobile invertebrates, and marine mammals.
SoMAS is located in an ideal coastal region for this research, with large
seasonal variation in temperature, large-scale and ecosystem level impacts
of climate change, and documented threats to coastal communities and
fishery resources.

Application should be received by January 5, 2024 for full consideration.
