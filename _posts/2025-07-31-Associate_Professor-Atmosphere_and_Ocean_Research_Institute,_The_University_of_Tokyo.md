The Department of Physical Oceanography (https://dpo.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.en.html) studies physical phenomena and fundamental processes related to ocean currents and ocean-atmosphere interactions for quantitative understanding through observations and elucidation of the mechanisms. We conduct research on the structure and variation of ocean circulation, the distribution, formation, and transformation of water masses, and ocean-atmosphere interactions and the resulting oceanic and atmospheric disturbances. In addition, as a member of the Joint Usage/Research Center, we actively engage in interdisciplinary research and promote collaboration with scientists both inside and outside the institute by planning and promoting big research projects and shipboard observations and by developing and introducing observation equipment, fluid experiment facilities, and numerical models.

This recruitment seeks a candidate who elucidates ocean circulation on a basin- to global-scale through research centered on shipboard observation, and who can lead the Japanese and international research community as a next-generation leader. We expect the candidate to deepen physical oceanography and also to develop advanced collaborative research with related research fields such as meteorology, chemical oceanography, and biological oceanography. Furthermore, in order to promote the activities of our institute as a Joint Usage/Research Center, we expect the candidate to actively engage in interdisciplinary cooperative research using the research vessels Hakuho Maru and Shinsei Maru, cooperative research at land facilities at Kashiwa, Otsuchi, and Amami, and international joint research. Furthermore, in order to foster human resources in atmospheric and oceanic sciences, we expect the candidate to be actively involved in graduate school education.
