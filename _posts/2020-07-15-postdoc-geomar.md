We are looking for a Postdoctoral scientist to conduct research on
climate modelling focusing on Southern Ocean processes. It is part of
the large-scale H2020 SO-CHIC project (2019-2023), in which 15
institutions across Europe participate (http://www.sochic-h2020.eu). The
overall objective of SO-CHIC is to understand and quantify the
variability of heat and carbon budgets in the Southern Ocean through an
investigation of the key processes controlling exchanges between the
atmosphere, ocean and sea ice using a combination of observational and
modelling approaches.

The successful candidate will investigate the impact of the Southern
Ocean polynya, particularly over the Weddell Sea, on the coupled climate
system. The approach will be based on the analysis of the
state-of-the-art climate model beyond IPCC-class, which resolves
mesoscale eddies over the Southern Ocean. Notably, the successful
candidate will run or analyse high-resolution AGCM and a global coupled
model incorporating a nested oceanic grid refinement in the Weddell sector.
