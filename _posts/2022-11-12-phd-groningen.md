Job description

The North Sea is a highly productive and heavily exploited continental
shelf sea that absorbs significant quantities of atmospheric CO2. But
the fate of absorbed CO2 is highly uncertain, in particular the
balance between outflow into the Atlantic Ocean and burial in
sediments, so we cannot accurately project how this may change in the
future. In the NoSE project “The role of the North Sea in the Atlantic
Ocean biogeochemical system: North Sea-Atlantic Exchange”, a
multidisciplinary consortium of researchers (NIOZ, Delft University of
Technology, University of Groningen, Utrecht University, and several
international partners) will determine the past, present and future
role of the North Sea within the wider biogeochemical system of the
Atlantic Ocean. Focusing on the Norwegian Trench, which is both the
main outflow route to the Atlantic Ocean and the main place where
sediments accumulate within the North Sea, we will investigate the
transport and conversion processes that regulate carbon and nutrient
exchange between land, shelf sea and open ocean through a combination
of oceanographic research expeditions and computer modelling. By
linking these results to the paleo-record from seafloor sediments,
NoSE will reveal new insights into how the cycling of carbon and
nutrients in the North Sea and their exchange with the Atlantic Ocean
have varied over the past thousands of years and how they may continue
to evolve in the future.

In this PhD-project, the in-house Earth System Model (ESM) EC-Earth
(http://www.ec-earth.org), a state-of-the-art global climate-carbon cycle
model will be used to simulate climate (atmosphere, ocean, ice),
vegetation, marine biochemistry, ocean primary production,
phytoplankton composition, and nutrient distributions. Specifically,
the ESM will be improved so as to minimize biases with the
regional-scale model. The improved model will then, in the context of
the multi-model CMIP6, be applied to make future projections/scenarios
of the coupled marine climate-phytoplankton system in the NoSE-North
Atlantic region and identify/quantify biochemical feedbacks governing
these changes. Using the ESM, the impacts of the NoSE region on the
global carbon cycle and ocean carbon storage will be assessed
(dissolved CO2 storage and the biological pump), and intermodel
differences in order to link these to mechanisms that govern the
response quantified. In this way, future carbon cycle changes in the
NoSE region in relation to North-Atlantic and global response
including uncertainties can be inferred. EC-Earth in the standard
resolution is part of CMIP6 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project
phase 6); model output from the multi-model ensemble of CMIP6 will be
used to assess intermodel uncertainty by comparing EC-Earth results
with other models in terms of biases, variability and future
projections. In this interdisciplinary project you will work closely
together with two postdocs (NIOZ, Texel/Yerseke) who will simulate
local and regional processes, as well as with several other PhD
candidates and postdocs working on field observations and
interpretation.

You will receive excellent training through innovative research
projects, advanced courses and training opportunities, complemented by
workshops on generic research, transferable skills and teaching. As a
PhD candidate, you are committed to conduct independent and original
scientific research, to report on this research in international
publications and presentations, and to present the results of the
research in a PhD dissertation, to be completed within 4 years. You
are expected to contribute 10% of the overall workload to teaching.
You will be stationed partly at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological
Institute (KNMI) in De Bilt, and partly at the University of
Groningen.

Qualifications

We are looking for:
- a motivated, practically skillful candidate
- a candidate with a MSc degree in climate, physics, marine biochemistry or a related subject
- a candidate with a background in (climate/carbon) modelling and/or analyses
- a candidate with experience in processing/analyzing large datasets (this will be considered an asset)
- a candidate with strong verbal and written communication skills (in English), as well as the ability to work independently and in a (diverse) team.

Organisation

Founded in 1614, the University of Groningen has an international
reputation as a dynamic and innovative centre of higher education
offering high-quality teaching and research. Balanced study and career
paths in a wide variety of disciplines encourage the 36,000 students
and researchers to develop their own individual talents. Belonging to
the best research universities in Europe and joining forces with
prestigious partner universities and networks, we are truly an
international place of knowledge.

The Faculty of Science and Engineering harbors a kaleidoscope of
disciplines and research strengths. Our programs in research and
education range from nanomaterials and biomachinery to astronomy, from
mathematics to pharmacy, from neurosciences to computer science, and
from molecular and evolutionary biology to marine biology.

The Energy and Sustainability Research Institute (ESRIG) is a highly
multidisciplinary institute performing research on energy and
sustainability. Activities include experimental and model studies as
well as studies into the societal interaction with scientific
knowledge. The research of the small CIO-Ocean group within ESRIG
focuses on primary production in the ocean by microscopic
phytoplankton, (polar) climate change by using state-of-the-art global
climate models and earth system models, micro-algae and macro-algae
(seaweeds), and trace metals and life in the ocean
(http://www.rug.nl/research/centre-for-isotope-research/research/cio-oceans).

Conditions of employment

The successful candidate will be offered, following the Collective
Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities:

- a full-time (1.0 FTE) position for four years
- a salary of € 2,541 gross per month in the first year, up to a maximum of € 3,247 gross per month in the fourth and final year for a full-time working week
- a holiday allowance of 8% gross annual income
- an 8.3% year-end bonus
- a position for four years; first, you will get a temporary position of one year with the option of renewal for another three years; extension of the contract is contingent on sufficient progress in the first year so that successful completion of the PhD thesis within the contract period is to be expected.

A PhD training program is part of the agreement and the candidate will
be enrolled in the Graduate School of the Faculty of Science and
Engineering.

Candidates are expected to start on April 1, 2023, at the latest.

Application

To be successful the application has to include:

- cover letter
- curriculum vitae
- transcripts from you bachelor’s and master’s degree
- contact details of three potential referees
- any other relevant documents (e.g., short research statement, awards, publications, language certifications).

You can submit your application until 30 October 2022 11:59pm / before
31 October 2022 Dutch local time (CET) by means of the application
form (click on "Apply" below on the advertisement on the university
website). Interviews are scheduled to take place in November 2022.

The University of Groningen strives to be a university in which

differences in background, experiences, perspectives, and identities.
We believe that working on our core values of inclusion and equality
are a joint responsibility and we are constructively working on
creating a socially safe environment. Diversity among students and
staff members enriches academic debate and contributes to the quality
of our teaching and research. We therefore invite applicants from
underrepresented groups in particular to apply. For more information,
see also our diversity policy webpage.

Our selection procedure follows the guidelines of the Recruitment code
(NVP): https://www.nvp-hrnetwerk.nl/sollicitatiecode/   and European
Commission's European Code of Conduct for recruitment of researchers:
https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/charter/code  .

We provide career services for partners of new faculty members moving
to Groningen.
