A team of PIs at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Tulane University has an NSF-funded project that will support a postdoc for up to 2 years. Application link here: https://apply.interfolio.com/140465. See details below:

**Qualifications**

-       Applicants should have a PhD degree or will have completed a PhD degree before the start date in geochemistry, oceanography, paleoclimatology, or other related fields.
-       Applicants should have previous experience in wet lab chemistry (preferentially clean lab operations). Additional experience in project-relevant skills, such as mass spectrometry (e.g., ICP-MS), isotope geochemistry, micropaleontology, or microscopy, is highly preferred.
-       We are particularly interested in self-motivated candidates with excellent critical thinking and quantitative skills (e.g., statistical analyses, and experiences with computational software like Matlab, Python, or R), and strong written and communication abilities. The ability to drive projects forward in a timely manner is crucial.

**Job description and responsibilities**

This NSF-funded project will focus on understanding past ocean oxygenation responses on glacial-interglacial timescales via thallium metal isotope and benthic foraminifera geochemistry data in sediment cores. The successful candidate will work with a team of PIs, including Dr. Yi Wang at Tulane University (https://paleochem.tulane.edu/), and Dr. Kassandra Costa (https://www.kassandracosta.com/about) and Dr. Sune Nielsen (https://www.whoi.edu/profile/snielsen/) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The postdoctoral researcher will analyze sedimentary metal isotope geochemistry (using MC-ICP-MS), foraminiferal morphology (via SEM), or foraminiferal stable isotope geochemistry (using mass spectrometer). They will also regularly meet with the PI team, present their work at conferences and in peer reviewed manuscripts, and organize and participate in outreach activities. The successful candidate will also have scientific flexibility to pursue their own research ideas within this context. The position includes travel between Tulane University and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for lab work and research updates. The preferential start state is first half-year of 2024 but is negotiable.
