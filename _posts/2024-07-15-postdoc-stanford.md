Applications are invited for a postdoctoral researcher in *ocean
modeling and theory* to work with Prof. Leif Thomas in the Department of
Earth System Science at Stanford University. The successful candidate
will pursue research on the interactions of internal waves with
submesocale currents in bottom boundary layers (BBLs) as part of a
NSF-funded, collaborative project with Prof. Jacob Wenegrat at the
University of Maryland.

BBLs on sloping bathymetry can support submesoscale currents with strong
shears and lateral density gradients. While progress has been made on
understanding the physics of BBL submesoscale flows in isolation,their
interactions with the ubiquitous internal wave field are relatively
unexplored. Theory predicts that such submesoscale currents can
significantly affect the properties and propagation of internal waves,
and in particular modify how the waves reflect off bathymetry, with
implications for wave breaking, mixing, and energy exchange between the
waves and currents.The successful candidate will test and extend these
theories using state-of-the-art, high-resolution numerical simulations
and analyses of mooring observations from the Gulf Stream, East
Greenland Current, and the Denmark Strait Overflow where internal
wave-mean flow interactions in the BBL are likely.

Candidates should have a strong background in geophysical fluid dynamics
with application to the ocean or atmosphere and knowledge in numerical
modeling. Evaluation of applications will begin immediately and will
continue until the position is filled. The start date would be in
Fall-Winter 2024, but completion of the PhD is required. The initial
appointment is for one year and may be renewable for one additional
year, subject to satisfactory performance, eligibility, and availability
of funding. Applications should be sent by email to leift@stanford.edu
and include a CV, brief statement of research interests, experience, and
future career plans, and the names and contact information of three or
more references.
