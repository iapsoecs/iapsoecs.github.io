The French Institute of Research for Development (IRD) opens a research

The aim of the proposed post-doctoral position is to improve the
Mercator Ocean International analysis system in the tropical band in
order to better constrain the tropical dynamics, its variability, and
improve the forecasting systems. The position will be at Mercator Ocean
International in Toulouse.

The candidate will join the Mercator Ocean International group and work
in close collaboration with the LEGOS “DYNOTROP” (Dynamics of the
Tropical Oceans) team, in particular with G. Ruggiero, E. Remy (Mercator
Océan) and S. Cravatte (LEGOS).

The application should be submitted before *October 1, 2020* for a start
no later than December, 1, 2020.
