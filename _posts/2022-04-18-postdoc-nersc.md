The call for a postdoc position in Sea-level Research at the Nansen Center (NERSC, Norway) has been extended till the 30th of April 2022.

The postdoc will investigate the processes connecting sea-level variability in the open ocean to the patterns observed over the shallow continental shelf areas, with a focus on the European continental shelf and northern high latitudes.

This position is funded by the Bjerknes Center for Climate Research (BCCR) under the SeaPR (Sea Level Prediction and Reconstruction) strategic project. The postdoc will be part of a research team including the partners of the BCCR with broad expertise in ocean remote sensing, ocean/climate modelling, and in-situ sea level observations.
