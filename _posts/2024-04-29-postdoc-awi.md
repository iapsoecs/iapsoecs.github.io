We have two 3-year PostDoc positions open on ocean biogeochemical modelling:

- The historical and future coastal ocean carbon sink: The tasks include development and tuning of a new seamless coastal set-up as well as producing and interpreting model simulations. The project is part of the ERC project OceanPeak. For more information, please see https://jobs.awi.de/Vacancies/1646/Description/2

- Detecting changes in Southern Ocean biogeography: This project encompasses some development of the biogeochemical model REcoM and conducting and interpreting model simulations. It is part of the EU project POMP (Polar Ocean Mitigation Potential, https://pomp-project.eu/). For more information, please see: https://jobs.awi.de/Vacancies/1645/Description/2

Closing date for application is 31 May 2024.
