Work type: Full time

Location: Hobart, Tasmania, Australia

Categories: Research Focused

Research Associate - Physical Oceanography

•          Fixed term, full time position until December 2025.

•          Based in Hobart. 

•          Contribute to the development of innovative concepts and ideas for further research.

 

Advertised: 26 Jul 2022

Applications close: 23 Aug 2022 Australian Eastern Standard Time

 

The Opportunity

 

The Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science (ACEAS) is a major $25M Special Research Initiative of the Australian Research Council.

 

The goal of ACEAS is to help the world community prepare for climate risks emerging from East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean by integrating knowledge of the ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere and ecosystems, and their interplay. ACEAS is a national-scale, University-led centre for excellence in Antarctic science focused on this goal.

 

ACEAS is led by the University of Tasmania with a range of Australian and International Partners (http://antarctic.org.au/).

 

Key Accountabilities:

•          Undertake innovative research using observations and high-resolution simulations to investigate the processes that drive cross-frontal fluxes of heat, freshwater and other tracers, and influence the magnitude of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation.

•          Prepare for and participate in the Denman marine science voyage for sampling of open-ocean to coastal exchanges of heat and freshwater and investigation of related physical processes.

•          Maintain a strong focus on communicating research findings by publishing in highly ranked journals and presenting to peers at local, national and global conferences and seminars.

•          Contribute to the communication of research findings to research users and the broader community.

•          Take on leadership opportunities that arise and contribute to the collegiate life of ACEAS/IMAS such as contributing to Honours and PhD supervision, committee membership, leading workshops, etc.

 

Your Application

 

To be successful in the role, your application will need to demonstrate;

•          A PhD in Physical Oceanography or an equivalent field.

•          Knowledge of atmosphere/ocean dynamics and climate processes and postdoctoral experience commensurate with the level of appointment, as demonstrated by a record of quality publications.

•          High level quantitative skills, as demonstrated through analysis and interpretation of complex ocean/atmosphere datasets or numerical simulations.

•          Experience in Southern Ocean research with particular emphasis on ocean circulation and frontal dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and/or Antarctic coastal current system.

•          A good record of, and continuing commitment to, research that attracts international recognition in the fields of Antarctic and Southern Ocean oceanography and climate science.

 

Remuneration

 

Appointment to this role will be at Academic Level A or Level B and will be determined based on the successful candidate’s level of skills, qualifications, and experience. The role will have a total remuneration package of up to $115,310 for Level A and $142,799 for Level B, comprising base salary within the range of $76,213 to $98,555 for Level A and $105,131 to $122,050 for level B plus 17% superannuation.
