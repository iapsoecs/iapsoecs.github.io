Postdoctoral Fellow Position: Global Warming in polar regions in ultra-high-resolution earth system model simulations
Employer: IBS Center for Climate Physics
Location: Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea
Education Level: PhD
Job type: Postdoctoral Fellow
Salary: 50-60 million KRW/year (~45,000-55,000 USD)
Term: Full Time, 2 year, with possibility for renewal

Applicants for this position should have a PhD in physics, climate sciences, meteorology, oceanography or a related field. Postdoctoral Fellows are expected to have strong computational skills, excitement to work on a new research subject, a good publication record, a high level of independence, curiosity and creativity, and an interest in working in an international and interdisciplinary research environment. The successful candidate will work with Prof. Axel Timmermann and Dr. Eui-Seok Chung to analyze our existing global high-resolution global warming CESM simulations (25 km atmosphere, 10 km ocean resolution) in terms of changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, sea-ice frontal interactions, polar amplification, clouds and ocean currents.

The IBS Center for Climate Physics (ICCP), (http://iccp.ibs.re.kr <http://iccp.ibs.re.kr/>) directed by Dr. Axel Timmermann, is dedicated to advancing the understanding of natural climate variability, man-made climate change and their impacts on the hydrological cycle, regional processes, ice-sheets, and sea level. The ICCP is generously funded through the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) (http://ibs.re.kr <http://ibs.re.kr/>).  ICCP is located in Busan, the second largest city in South Korea and the ninth largest port city in the world. Surrounded by ocean and mountains, the city has a dramatic natural background. From designer cafes, international movie and art festivals, award-winning restaurants to temples at the end of hiking trails, Busan has something to offer for everyone.

Please submit a cover letter, a short statement of your research interests, curriculum vitae, the name of 2 references, and up to three publications to Ms. U-Jeong Seo (u_jeongs@pusan.ac.kr <mailto:u_jeongs@pusan.ac.kr>). If you have any further questions regarding these positions, please contact Axel Timmermann (timmermann@pusan.ac.kr <mailto:timmermann@pusan.ac.kr>). The position remains open until filled.
