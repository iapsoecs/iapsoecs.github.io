The Department of Oceanography at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (UHM) invites applications for a full-time, tenure-track, 9-month faculty position in Ocean Biogeochemical Modeling at the rank of assistant professor.

 

We seek a candidate who will expand the expertise of our department and integrate cutting-edge research with undergraduate and graduate education. Since its founding over half a century ago, the department has been a world leader in interdisciplinary oceanographic research and education, and we are excited to grow our dynamic, vibrant community with new colleagues to continue this legacy. UHM is an internationally recognized R1 university that draws students from many places including Hawaiʻi, the Pacific Islands, and Asia. Our campus welcomes all students but given our responsibilities to the community in which we operate, as part of our strategic mission, we strive to become a Native Hawaiian Place of Learning, a place that is committed to integrating Native Hawaiian language, culture and/or values into its academic and campus environment. The Department of Oceanography is committed to serving and affirming our unique community and culture in the center of the Pacific Ocean and to continued research excellence.

 

The successful candidate will conduct research that addresses problems in ocean biogeochemistry using modeling techniques at any spatial or temporal scale. We encourage applications that highlight the potential to use data-driven techniques, such as machine-learning and artificial intelligence (AI), to accelerate discovery by integrating vast observational datasets and through the construction of complex models. The successful candidate will be co-affiliated with the International Pacific Research Center, the hub of global climate system science at UHM.

 

Position duties include: develop and sustain a vigorous extramurally supported, collaborative research program that complements existing expertise in the department; conduct outstanding classroom teaching and mentoring of students in the department; and provide service to the department, school, university, and larger scientific community.

 

Minimum qualifications: Ph.D. degree in Oceanography, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences or a related discipline; post-doctoral research experience, or equivalent; ability for creative, high-quality research, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed publications; demonstrated ability for effective written and oral communication.

 

Desirable qualifications: success in competition for extramural grants, contracts, or fellowships; interest in developing advanced courses in chemical oceanography to complement the department’s curriculum; ability to effectively teach and mentor undergraduate or graduate students from varied backgrounds; ability to work collaboratively and maintain an environment of mutual respect; research interests that complement existing expertise in ocean biogeochemistry within the Department of Oceanography, including seagoing research; interest in contributing to cross-campus initiatives focused on AI and data science.
