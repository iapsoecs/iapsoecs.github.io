The Center for Climate Systems Research in the Climate School of Columbia University in New York invites applicants for Postdoctoral Research Scientist position to conduct research on Arctic Climate Study.

The Postdoctoral Research Scientist will use observational data and climate model to study the interactions between radiation, clouds, sea ice and ocean in the polar climate system, with a focus on investigating different feedbacks (e.g., ice albedo feedback and cloud feedback) to understand the mechanism for the Arctic amplification. An innovative method (e.g., the radiative kernel approach) will be used to quantify the feedback and the satellite and in situ observations will be used to evaluate the modeling results.

The Postdoctoral Research Scientist will be expected to perform original research, present the results of the research at scientific meetings, and prepare publications in peer-reviewed journals.

Qualifications

    - A PhD in atmospheric sciences, physics, or other relevant fields is required.
    
    - Strong mathematical and programming skills.
    
    - Experience in radiative transfer modeling and satellite data analysis.
    
    - Expertise in running global climate simulations is not required but desired.
