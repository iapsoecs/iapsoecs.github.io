The Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI) is seeking qualified candidates
to establish a new research group that investigates the physical
oceanography of the Gulf of Maine and adjacent bodies of water â€”
specifically around questions relating to circulation changes in the NW
Atlantic, drivers of warming and interannual variability in ocean
temperature and sea level in the Gulf of Maine, etc. The successful
candidate will have experience and interest in building a research group
using multiple investigatory techniques and datasets including remote
sensing observations. A strong quantitative background in, and technical
knowledge of, atmosphere-ocean interactions, teleconnections, and/or
climate modes (and their manifestations in the marine domain) as applied to
questions akin to those above is preferred. The successful candidate will
function as part of an interdisciplinary research program focusing on
climate, physical, biological, and socio-economic factors that affect the
Gulf of Maine ecosystem and the communities that depend on it for their
livelihoods and well-being.

Salary Range: $78,589 - $99,600
