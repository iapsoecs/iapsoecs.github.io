The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (https://sse.tulane.edu/eens) at Tulane University invites applications for two full-time, tenure-track faculty positions.  One position will be filled at the Assistant Professor level, and one position will be filled at either the Assistant or Associate Professor level. Application link: https://apply.interfolio.com/135147.

We seek broad-based Earth and Environmental scientists with research interests in the general field of Earth System and Climate interactions, covering the Earth's critical zone, pedosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and/or atmosphere. Disciplinary expertise may include but is not limited to atmospheric and climate sciences, carbon cycling and other Earth-atmosphere interactions, hydrology and geomorphology, but with a demonstrable Earth Systems Science approach. Research areas should complement current faculty expertise and offer potential for collaborative research in the department and the wider university.

Applicants should submit (i) a cover letter (no more than two pages) that highlights the rank (Assistant or Associate Professor) at which the applicant wishes to apply, why they are interested in this opportunity, and how they will build an inclusive educational environment; (ii) a curriculum vitae; (iii) research and teaching statements that articulate how the mission of the department would be enhanced; (iv) an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion statement; and (v) the names and contact information of three references.

Review of applications will begin on December 11th 2023 and continue until the position is filled.

Inquiries may be directed to Dr. Dan Friess (dfriess@tulane.edu), Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Tulane University, 6823 St. Charles Ave., New Orleans, LA 70118-5698.
