The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) is a multidisciplinary center for climate and Earth system research located in Hamburg, Germany. It is one of the premier climate science research institutes in the world. Located in the heart of one of Europe’s most livable and vibrant cities, it provides a highly international and interdisciplinary environment to conduct scientific research as well as access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities. You can also have a virtual tour to our campus.

 

The Cluster of Excellence “Climate, Climatic Change, and Society” (CLICCS) is led by the University of Hamburg, with the MPI-M as one of the core partners.  CLICCS investigates climate dynamics and climate-related social dynamics, as well as the interactions between the two. To this end, CLICCS is looking for colleagues from a wide range of disciplines, including the natural sciences as well as the social sciences. We are proud to work together in a truly integrating manner. Visit CLICCS for more job openings.

 

## THE POSITION

 

The MPI-M invites applications for a 2.5-year position as a

 

Postdoctoral | Research Scientist (W-0056 | all genders)

 

within the CLICCS project to investigate the high-latitude fluid dynamics of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in observations and km-scale climate simulations.

 

The project aims to characterize how small-scale processes set the relationship between convective mixing, boundary currents, and subpolar overturning.  The post holder will compare existing observations of these processes with their simulated counterparts in the ICON next-generation climate model.  The successful candidate will join the Climate Variability Department and work in close collaboration with the Experimental Oceanography group at the University of Hamburg.  Furthermore, there will be close collaboration with the EU-funded project Explaining and Predicting the Ocean Coveyor (EPOC). 

 

## YOUR PROFILE

* PhD degree in physical oceanography, meteorology, physics, mathematics, engineering, or a related field
* Experience with km-scale model simulations is an advantage
* Excellent programming skills in Python (or related languages)
* Proven record of high-quality research, demonstrated through publications, presentations, and references
* Strong written and oral communication skills, and the ability to work independently as well as collaboratively

 

## OUR OFFER

* Participation in a challenging part of science in an international, intellectually stimulating environment
* Access to complex workflows on the bleeding edge of what is technologically possible, as well as working for and with an open-source community
* A network of very experienced and innovative colleagues within the institute, and at partner institutions with a long-proven tradition of sharing knowledge and information
* Possibility for flexible time-management and measures to support work-life balance
* Attractive benefits including subsidy for public transport across Germany (Deutschlandticket)

 

## EMPLOYEEMENT CONDITIONS
