Deadline 1 Sep 23:59 CEST

Expected start 1 Nov

    Department of Geoscience Høegh-Guldbergs Gade 2 8000 Aarhus C
    Fixed term full-time position 1 Nov 2024 - 31 Oct 2026 ID: 15527 

Apply

The Paleoceanography and Paleoclimate Group at the Department of Geoscience, Aarhus University, Denmark, invites applications for a position in paleoceanography at the postdoctoral level. The successful candidate will be part of a research group studying Holocene and late Quaternary paleoclimate and paleoceanography of the North Atlantic and Arctic regions. The postdoctoral project is part of the large international EU Horizon Europe project, Sea-Quester on the effect of climate change on carbon cycling and burial in the Arctic region. The role of Aarhus University in the project is to provide the long-term perspective on these changes and quantify carbon sequestration in different environmental and sedimentary settings. The position has a fixed term of 2 years, starting from 1 November 2024 or as soon as possible thereefter. 

Job description

The postdoctoral project will focus on investigating the link between temporal changes in climate, biodiversity and ecosystems in the Greenland and North Atlantic regions, with special focus on the carbon cycle and the burial and fate of carbon in the sediments. Specific tasks will include the quantification of carbon sequestration in sea-floor sediments across space and time and to investigate links between climatic and environmental conditions and carbon burial. Other questions to address include the role of the benthic fauna in carbon sequestration and identifying and distinguishing the various sources of carbon input to the sediments. The successful candidate will be investigating marine sediment cores using tools from organic and inorganic geochemistry, micropaleontology, and sedimentology. Within the Sea-Quester project's framework, there is considerable freedom for the postdoctoral researcher to develop the project with the Aarhus University hosts.

Facilities

All laboratory facilities at the Department of Geoscience will be available for the research project. This includes an Agilent GC-MS/FID, Agilent Py-GC-MS, WildCat Hawk pyrolysis, TESCAN SEM, (LA-)ICP-MS, ITRAX Core scanner, Sympatec laser diffraction grain size analyzer, and various light microscopes for microfossil analyses. Carbon isotope analyses via EA-IRMS is available through close collaboration with a neighboring department. The Paleoceanography & Paleoclimate Research Group hosts an extensive sediment core repository with marine sediment cores from all around the North Atlantic Ocean, primarily around Greenland. Most cores are well-dated and have already been analyzed for various other research studies. All cores and samples are available for the project.

Qualifications

The successful applicant will have a PhD in geoscience or related fields. Candidates should preferably have knowledge of Arctic paleoceanography and organic geochemistry, although specialists in other techniques/proxies, including inorganic geochemistry, are also invited to apply. Experience with multi-proxy studies, biomarker analyses, carbon chemistry and/or numerical/statistical data treatment will be considered favorably. Excellent oral and written English skills are a requirement.

Deadline

The deadline for applications is September 1st, 2024. We expect to conduct interviews in mid-September, and the successful candidate will be able to start between November 1st, 2024 and February 1st, 2025.

Application

The application must include the following:

    Cover Letter, including motivation for applying and information on how the candidate’s expertise and experience will aid the project
    Curriculum Vitae, including a list of publications
    PhD certificate or a statement regarding the expected date of completing of PhD studies
    One page statement of research goals
    Contact information (name, position, institution, email) for three references

We refer to the faculty’s guidelines for applicants.

Aarhus University’s ambition is to be an attractive and inspiring workplace for all and to foster a culture in which each individual has opportunities to thrive, achieve and develop. We view equality and diversity as assets, and we welcome all applicants.
