The Institute of Environmental Physics at Heidelberg University invites
applications for a PhD position (three years, starting from 1.6.2022). The
position is placed within the "Physics of Environmental Archives" group of
Prof. Norbert Frank and Dr. Sophie Warken. The project entitled "Quantifying
post Little-Ice-Age freshwater discharge and ocean dynamics in the Central
American Sea using a novel tracer combination: "234U - (P)SST - 14C" is part
of the externally funded DFG Priority Programme "Tropical Climate
Variability and Coral Reefs" (SPP 2299).

Please find more details about the project at the following link:

Reviews of applications will start shortly, but will continue until the
position is filled - so we are still open for applications.

For any questions please contact Prof. Dr. Norbert Frank
(norbert.frank@iup.uni-heidelberg.de) or Dr. Sophie Warken (sophie.warken@iup.uni-heidelberg.de).
