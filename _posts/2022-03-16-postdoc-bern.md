PostDoc in Earth system modeling with a focus on adaptive scenarios

https://www.climate.unibe.ch/

The Ocean Modelling group of the Climate- and Environmental Physics Division at the University
of Bern is seeking applications for a postdoc position in the area of Earth system
modeling. An adaptive emission reduction approach has recently been developed at the
University of Bern. This approach allows developing emission trajectories for CO2 and other
radiative forcing agents that would iteratively adapt to meet the temperature goals of the
Paris Agreement. Several modeling centers have now run simulations using this novel approach.
The goal of the Post-Doc project is to analyze the adaptive CO2 scenario simulations from
multiple Earth system models with a focus on the ocean physics and biogeochemistry, but
analysis of the global Earth system are also planned. In addition, targeted
simulations will be conducted with NOAA’s GFDL fully coupled Earth system model to complement
the existing multi-model simulations. The research will be embedded within the 4C
project which aims at reducing the uncertainty in our quantitative understanding of
carbonclimate interactions and feedbacks.

The project offers the opportunity to work with a comprehensive climate-carbon cycle Earth
system model and to collaborate with carbon cycle experts within the 4C project
(https://4ccarbon.eu) and the Climate and Environmental Physics Division. In addition, the researcher
will profit from being an active part of the dynamical ocean modeling group. The candidate
will present results at international scientific meetings and publish in peer-reviewed literature.
The candidate is also encouraged to work on related topics and to develop her/his own
projects. The salary is according to the guidelines of the University of Bern. The term of
appointment is for two years.

We are looking for an outstanding postdoctoral researcher with a PhD in oceanography,
Earth sciences, physics, mathematics, or related fields. Candidates with a strong background
in climate modeling, the analysis of large datasets and in ocean biogeochemistry or
carbon cycle are preferred. The position requires the ability and interest to work across
disciplines, and the proven ability to work independently.

Applications should include a motivation letter, CV, publication list, web link to the PhD
thesis, and the contact details of three references. The application should be submitted as
a single pdf file to Prof. Thomas Frölicher (thomas.froelicher@unibe.ch). Consideration of
applications begins on March 25. The project start is preferentially in spring 2022.
