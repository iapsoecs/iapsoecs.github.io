NOAA’s Ocean Observing and Monitoring Division (newly promoted as the  Global Ocean Monitoring and Observing Program - GOMO) is seeking a Physical Scientist to manage and organize NOAA’s contribution to the ARGO Program - an international ocean-observing program that gathers temperature, salinity, and biogeochemical profiles of the world’s oceans, allowing scientists to advance understanding of the role of the oceans in the earth system. The U.S. Argo Program maintains about half of the global fleet and deploys around 350 new Argo floats each year. 

The Argo Program Manager is responsible for managing all aspects of the U.S. Argo program, including both intra and extramural research activities. She/he will conduct program planning activities including short and long-term resource planning; develop and communicate program and project goals; and monitor and evaluate progress. She/he leads and supports efforts to expand and innovate program activities and partnerships, and organizes or participates in relevant conferences, meetings, and panels. She/he will stay current on ocean observing requirements and strategies, and maintain knowledge of relevant sensor and Argo platform technologies, and develop relationships with universities, labs, institutions, and businesses that develop them. Moreover, she/he will develop and nurture partnerships and relationships with other agencies and international partners to coordinate and grow the program. 

GOMO is looking to hire a Physical Scientist at the ZP-IV level, located at NOAA headquarters in Silver Spring, MD. The position is open to U.S. Citizens or Nationals and will be filled using direct hire authority.
