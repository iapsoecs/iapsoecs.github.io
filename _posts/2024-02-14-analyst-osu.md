The Lagrangian Ocean Lab in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University is looking for a data manager/analyst to join our team. The position duties are varied and will be influenced by the selected candidateâ€™s qualifications, but will include developing computational workflows for real-time data acquisition and processing, model set up, and data analysis. The selected candidate will be expected to interact with students and postdocs in the group.

The Lagrangian Ocean Lab is a new and dynamic research group that focuses on elucidating physical-biological interactions in the coastal ocean. To do so, we combine in situ measurements from novel instruments, including underwater robots and on biologging seabirds, and numerical experiments with particle tracking. 

Support for this position is through grants and is expected to continue past the initial appointment. The starting salary within the expected salary range ($60,000-$75,000) will be commensurate with skills, education, and experience. The position can be held in Corvallis or Newport, OR. Full-time is preferred, but part-time is possible. For additional information please contact Jessica Garwood at Jessica.Garwood@oregonstate.edu.

Benefits at OSU are outstanding (e.g., low premiums, pension plan option; see posting for more information).

The deadline for full consideration is March 1, 2024.
