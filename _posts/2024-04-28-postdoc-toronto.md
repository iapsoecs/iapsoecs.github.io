We are looking for two post-doctoral researchers with ecological expertise
in modelling the impacts of climate change, in this case for ice dynamics.
The post-doctoral researchers will contribute to a new international and
transdisciplinary project aiming to co-develop adaptation measures and
technological solutions to decrease the frequency of drownings and
accidents in response to hazardous cryospheric conditions for circumpolar
Arctic Indigenous communities to promote enhanced mobility, food security,
in addition to physical and mental health. The post-doctoral researchers
will map and forecast safe cryospheric conditions across the Arctic, in
addition to supporting the project management of the broader team and the
flexibility to develop independent projects of mutual interest. This is a
transdisciplinary project with active collaboration from researchers and
communities across Canada, the United Kingdom, and Norway.

Funding is available for 2 years. The successful applicant will have a PhD
in ecology, limnology, applied statistics, climate science, or a relevant
field, experience harmonizing large datasets collected from different
sources, technical expertise acquiring and analysing large-scale climate
data, advanced data analytical skills in R, Python, or Matlab, and the
ability to work effectively with an interdisciplinary team.

Applications are due on May 15, 2024. Preferred start date is July 1, 2024,
but the starting date is negotiable. Applicants should submit a cover
letter detailing their relevant background and experiences, a CV, and names
and contact information for three references. Only those applicants
selected for consideration will be contacted for an online
interview. Inquiries about the position and applications may be sent with
