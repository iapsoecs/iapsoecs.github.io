The Department of Oceanography in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (UHM) invites applications for two tenure-track 9-month faculty positions at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor. Incoming faculty will be leaders within the new Uehiro Center for the Advancement of Oceanography within the Department of Oceanography (UC•AO; https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/uc-ao/), and will receive research support of $150K per year for five years. Dual career partners that qualify for the positions are encouraged to apply.

 

We seek two Oceanographers who will complement and expand the expertise of our department and integrate cutting-edge research with undergraduate and graduate education. Successful candidates will lead research programs that contribute to our department’s strategic goal to be a global leader in advancing a comprehensive Mauka to Makai (mountain to the sea) understanding of the ocean in the context of global change. Relevant research areas include any discipline within the field of oceanography. As leaders within the UC•AO, successful candidates will be expected to catalyze cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research that addresses consequential scientific questions broadly complementary to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

 

Since its founding over half a century ago, the Department of Oceanography has been a world leader in interdisciplinary oceanographic research and education, and we are excited to grow our dynamic, vibrant community with new colleagues to carry this legacy into the future. UHM is the only recognized Native Hawaiian-serving R1 university and draws students from a diverse population including Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian ethnicities. The Department is committed to continued research excellence, and to serving and affirming our unique community and culture in the center of the Pacific Ocean.

 

Position duties include: developing and sustaining a vigorous, extramurally-supported, collaborative research program that complements existing expertise in the department and school; conducting outstanding classroom teaching and mentoring of students in both the graduate Oceanography and undergraduate Global Environmental Science programs; and providing service to the department, school, university, and the larger scientific community.              

Required qualifications include a Ph.D. in a relevant field; capability to conduct creative, high-quality research that addresses consequential scientific questions broadly complementary to departmental goals; capacity to serve in a leadership role; the ability to effectively teach and mentor a diverse population of undergraduate and graduate students; and commitment to support our shared values of inclusion, mutual respect, collaboration, and equity, so that people from every background feel welcome and can thrive. Applicants for an Assistant Professor position should have several years of experience at that level (or equivalent at a non-academic institution). Applicants for an Associate Professor position should have a minimum of four years of full-time college or university teaching at the rank of assistant professor or equivalent.                       

Desirable qualifications include research that contributes to interdisciplinary collaboration, involves sea-going data collection, utilizes the oceanographic setting of Hawaiʻi, or utilizes UH research platforms. The University of Hawai‘i Marine Center is home to the R/V Kilo Moana and the ROV Lu‘ukai: http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/cms/uh-marine-center.
