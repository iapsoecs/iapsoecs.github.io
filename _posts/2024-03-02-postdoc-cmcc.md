Ocean extremes Data Analyst (code 12540)

Deadline: March 10, 2024

ABOUT US

The CMCC Foundation is a scientific research center on climate change and its interactions with the environment, society, the world of business, and policymakers.
Our work aims to stimulate sustainable growth, protect the environment, and develop strategies for the adaptation and mitigation of climate change.

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

Our Institute for Earth System Predictions (IESP) is looking for a position of Post-doc as Ocean extremes Data Analyst  to work within the ObsSea4Clim project framework.
ObsSea4Clim is a Horizon Europe project which brings together key European actors within ocean observing science, climate assessment and Earth System modelling with users of oceanographic products and services to deliver an improved observation framework based on Essential Ocean & Climate Variables (EOV/ECVs). ObsSea4Clim has the goals of improving the monitoring, understanding, reporting and projections of essential physical oceanic processes related to climate and changes over time, and of producing related EOVs and indicators at regional or sea basin scale.

Workplace location: Bologna
                                            
ROLE

The Data Analyst will focus on the analysis of sea surface and subsurface temperature EOVs and their extremes, called Marine Heatwaves (MHWs). The activities will include the development of innovative regional marine heatwaves indicators (e.g. Mediterranean Sea) from observations and reanalyses, and their evaluation in the current state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) with the aim of constraining the uncertainty in climate predictions and improving projections at global and regional scale. Improved process understanding in combination with advanced statistical methods for ensemble screening and AI optimization of model parameters will be investigated to reduce model biases. The candidate is further expected to contribute to a review of EOV requirements through stakeholder engagement.

RESPONSIBILITIES

The Data Analyst is responsible for:

    Performing scientific and statistical analysis on a wide range of ocean data products and models.
    Presenting research and updates in the project meetings.
    Writing project reports and scientific articles.

    PhD in natural sciences with experience in the fields of climate and/or oceanography. Other PhDs in the field of geosciences and statistical sciences will also be considered;
    good knowledge and skills in programming language (e.g. Python, matlab, R);
    good communication skills and team-working attitude;
    proficient skills of spoken and written English.

DURATION, COMPENSATION & BENEFITS
