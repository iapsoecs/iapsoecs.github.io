Closing date: 04 Nov 2021.

Sea-Ice Data Analyst
•   Map and deliver end-to-end downloads, verification, storage and
access of a wide range of environmental data and imagery for broad use
in Earth System science.
•  Independently undertake basic validation and analysis in support of
cutting edge climate-research projects, including high-end graphical
presentations.
•  Lead or contribute to relevant research including presentations,
publications, WWW portals and reports.

Who we are
The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) is part of the Commonwealth
Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. As primary
agency for Australia's Antarctic Program (AAP), the AAD is responsible
for achieving the Australian Government's Antarctic goals. These goals
are to:

•  maintain the Antarctic Treaty System and enhance Australia's
influence within it
•  protect the Antarctic environment
•  understand the role of Antarctica in the global climate system
•  undertake scientific work of practical, economic and national significance.

The AAD also has responsibility for administering the Australian
Antarctic Territory and the Territory of Heard and McDonald Islands.

The AAD Science Branch leads, conducts and supports a world class
program of scientific research and environmental management,
consistent with national priorities through the Australian Antarctic
Science Strategic Plan. The branch provides research and advice to
support Australia’s Antarctic policy objectives, including
participation in the Antarctic Treaty system and other international
committees, commissions and intergovernmental panels. It manages and
administers the Australian Antarctic Science Program (including
project requests, assessment, and reporting) and provides scientific
and research advice to support regulatory and management decisions.
The branch provides scientific advice for Antarctic capability
projects, conducts impact assessments and develops strategies to
address environmental legacies and undertakes targeted outreach
promoting the value of Australian Antarctic science.

The Antarctic Climate Program investigates a range of Antarctic and
Southern Ocean components of the climate system. Its team studies
Antarctic atmosphere, sea ice, ice sheets and past climate using ice
cores. The Antarctic Climate Program is well integrated within the
Australian Antarctic Program Partnership at the University of Tasmania
and holds links into the Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic
Science, an Australian Research Council funded program.

The Job
The key duties of the role include, but are not limited to:
•  playing a lead role in the acquisition and specialised processing
of a range of data streams from:
- satellite sensors eg synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical and
thermal infrared
- other relevant sources eg remotely-operated vehicles, autonomous
underwater and airborne platforms
- in situ instrument packages (including buoys) and various ship-borne sensors.
•  the processing and integration of ancillary spatially-resolved data
streams eg from GPS, acoustic positioning systems and inertial
navigation systems
•  developing and applying specialised software, analysis tools and
scripts to processing and analysing the various data streams
•  contributing to the interpretation and production of research
outputs relating to the Antarctic sea ice environment by:
- developing innovative algorithms and using advanced techniques such
as machine learning
- using high-performance computing
- taking a lead in managing the various data streams and data sets.
•  playing a lead role in, or contributing to, the writing of
technical reports and peer-reviewed publications arising from the
work, and also in the presentation of results
•  engaging and collaborating with sea ice, remote-sensing and other
data providers, analysts, users and scientists locally, nationally and
internationally, to enhance strategic research partnerships and
research outcomes
•  supporting and actively promoting a culture of safety, compliance
and continuous improvement within the Science Branch.
