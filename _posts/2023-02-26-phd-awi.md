We have two open PhD positions in ocean biogeochemical modelling at the
Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar- and Marine Research.

PhD position 'Future projections of Net Primary Production under warming:
Revisiting the temperature dependence of phytoplankton functional types' is
in the framework of the Horizon Europe project OceanICU: Improving Carbon
Understanding. https://jobs.awi.de/Vacancies/1273/Description/2

PhD position 'The historical ocean carbon sink and the role of ventilation'
is in the framework of the ERC starting grant project OceanPeak: The global
ocean carbon cycle after peak emissions, dynamics and process attribution
in a seamless model from coastal shelves to the open ocean.
https://jobs.awi.de/Vacancies/1275/Description/2

Both positions will provide ample opportunity to network with the
international cooperation partners. Closing date for application is 23
February 2023.

Note that another opening for a PostDoc position on Benchmarking Global
Carbon Budget ocean biogeochemistry models in the framework of the Horizon
Europe project OceanICU: Improving Carbon Understanding will follow soon.

Thank you for sharing with interested candidates, and I'm more than happy
to answer any questions regarding these positions.
