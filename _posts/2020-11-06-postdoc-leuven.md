**PostDoc position at KU Leuven**

Decadal climate variability in Antarctica: The role of atmospheric feedbacks (ref. BAP-2020-824) 

A consortium of five Belgian universities is seeking a Postdoctoral reseacher to work in the framework of the PARAMOUR project (Decadal Predictability and vAriability of polar climate: the Role of AtMosphere- Ocean-cryosphere mUltiscale inteRactions) funded by the program EOS â€“The excellence of Science. PARAMOUR aims at revealing fundamental drivers of climate variability and assessing climate predictability in high latitudes by using coupled regional climate models in both hemispheres. http://www.climate.be/paramour 

**Project** 

The climate of the Polar Regions has dramatically changed over the last decades. This may have resulted from external forcing (e.g., from greenhouse gas emissions), but also from natural interaction between the components of the climate system (notably, the atmosphere, the marine and continental cryosphere, and the ocean). Quantifying the specific contribution of each is critical to understand decadal variability. Based on the complementary scientific expertise of the project partners, PARAMOUR aims at revealing fundamental drivers of climate variability and assessing the predictability in high-latitudes by using coupled regional climate models in both hemispheres. The successful candidate will contribute to the development of a high-resolution coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice-ice sheet model configuration covering Antarctica, in collaborations with the other scientists working on the project. The technical aspects associated to model development will be supported by a HPC consultant. Currently the technical coupling is finalized, but physical performance needs to be improved. Therefore the first task will be to improve the performance and to carry out an in-depth evaluation of the coupled model. After, the Postdoctoral researcher will analyse the interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and ice shelves at scales between a few hundreds of meters and a few kilometres, the way they are represented in models and their impact on the variability and predictability of the system. Special attention will be given to atmospheric feedback processes like those between clouds and radiation and those between surface albedo and atmospheric processes(for example the darkening of the surface due to scouring by the wind). KU Leuven pursues an equal opportunities and diversity policy. 

**Profile** 

Required qualifications: 
- To have a PhD degree in Earth or Environmental Science, Climatology or related field (geography, meteorology physics, mathematics, informatics, bioscience engineering, civil engineering, etc.); 
- To have demonstrated experience in computational programming, preferably at HPC facilities; Experience with climate modelling is a strong asset. 
- To have demonstrated verbal and written communication skills in English; 
- To have interest in working in a multidisciplinary team environment. 

**Offer** 
Postdoctoral Researcher Starting date between January 1 and March 1, 2021
