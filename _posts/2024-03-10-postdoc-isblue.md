The aim of the programme is to give creative young scientists the
opportunity to develop their own research project in one of the ISblue
laboratories (Western Brittany, France).

ISblue themes range from the coastal environment to the deep sea, bringing
together research in all disciplines: ocean and geosciences, ecosystems,
new technologies for observation, and the human societies living near the
sea.

Four fellowships will be awarded in 2024.

Fellows are appointed for two years.
Funding includes salary and support for travel or small equipment and
supplies.

Deadline for submission:
Tuesday April 30th, 2024 - 09:59 PM (French Hour)
