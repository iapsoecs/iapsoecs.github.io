A postdoctoral position in Ocean, Atmosphere, and Climate Dynamics is available at Yale University to join Prof. Alexey Fedorov’s group in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (http://people.earth.yale.edu/profile/alexey-fedorov/about). General fields of research include ocean and atmosphere circulation, ocean-atmosphere interactions, the ocean’s role in climate, climate variability and change. Particular focus will be on (1) ENSO and tropical climate, (2) climate links between different ocean basins, (3) stability, variability, and climate impacts of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The work will involve climate modeling, analyses of observational and GCM data, and analytical approaches. A PhD in physical oceanography, atmospheric sciences or related disciplines is required. Previous experience with climate GCMs is a big plus. Funding is currently available up to three years. Successful candidates can begin their program at Yale in the Fall of 2024; later or earlier starting dates are also possible. Review of applications will start on May 1, 2024, and will continue until the position is filled. Applicants should email their CV, a brief statement of research interests, a representative publication, and the contacts of three referees to Prof. Fedorov (alexey.fedorov@yale.edu; subject: postdoctoral search). Shortlisted candidates will be contacted.
