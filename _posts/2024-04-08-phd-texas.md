Texas A&M Department of Oceanography is seeking graduate student(s) starting fall 2024 to work in the Potter lab. Research in this lab focuses on physical processes of the air-sea interface including fluxes, waves, hurricanes, and upper ocean dynamics using an observational approach.

We seek students who are highly self-motivated, independent, and creative thinkers who are enthusiastic about pursuing a career in oceanography. A strong background in math, computer programming (e.g., MATLAB, R, Python), and statistics is desired.  There are several projects that a prospective student could develop into a dissertation or thesis.

Prospective students should apply through TAMU application portal (https://applicant.tamu.edu/). Prior to applying, please contact Henry Potter (hpotter@tamu.edu) with your CV, a brief description of your research interests, and an unofficial transcript. Graduate research funding is available contingent upon academic progress.

Women, veterans, people with disabilities, and individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM are particularly encouraged to apply.
