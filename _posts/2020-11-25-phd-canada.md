**Graduate positions in marine biogeochemistry**

Several fully funded graduate positions (MSc or PhD) are available in the Reader Lab at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada. Projects are field and laboratory based are focussed on different aspects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in marine systems. Available projects fall within the broad themes of DOM and the microbial carbon pump, seasonality in DOM fluxes, and chemical fingerprinting. Successful candidates will join a dynamic laboratory and will work as part of larger collaborative projects.

The Reader Lab is located at Memorial University of Newfoundland in the beautiful town of St John’s, NL, the easternmost city in North America. Situated in the North Atlantic, much of the research at Memorial University has a strong focus on the ocean.

At the time of appointment, candidates should possess at minimum a Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science, Marine Science, Chemistry, Biology, Ecology, or a related field. Please send a cover letter (1 page) explaining your interest in the position, CV, and list of 2-3 references to Dr. Heather Reader at hreader@mun.ca
