# Description

## Our mission

Climate change is causing deep uncertainty at all levels of society, with climate volatility reducing the security of all land-based assets and posing a multi-level security threat for the functioning of enterprises, societies, and governments.

Mitiga is a spinoff of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which hosts MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe.

Mitiga's mission is firmly rooted in employing cutting-edge science and technology to mitigate the multifaceted risks posed by climate-driven perils. Our approach spans a spectrum of temporal scales, from real-time and annual forecasts to projections spanning the next century. This comprehensive perspective on risk, coupled with our capacity to transfer risks to capital markets via catastrophe bonds, positions us to significantly contribute to enhanced climate mitigation, resilience, and equity.

And we need you.

We are seeking a highly skilled Climate Scientist to support our climate science team in delivering impactful solutions. The ideal candidate will play a crucial role in processing climate datasets, developing new methodologies, and contributing to innovative product creation. This role requires expertise in climate modeling, data analysis, and Python programming to support various projects within an agile team environment.


## Key Responsibilities:

* Refine existing product offerings to better align with client needs in close collaboration with product and science teams.
* Integrate big datasets, implement advanced algorithms, and apply cutting-edge methodologies to improve data analysis and climate modeling.
* Work closely to the data engineering team to design and deploy applications for faster, more impactful insights.
* Support the science teams to deliver reports on climate-related projects.
* Contribute to the creation of new climate-related products and solutions. 

## Qualifications:

* Advanced degree (Master’s or PhD preferred) in atmospheric science, mathematics, climate/earth system science, hydrology, or a related field.
* 1-2 years' experience working with climate models (e.g., CMIP6, GCMs, RCMs) and expertise in ensemble analysis and uncertainty quantification, or climate risk analysis and statistical methods.
* Preferred experienced in flood/hydrological modeling, bias correction, downscaling techniques, and climate impact assessments. Knowledge of machine learning is a plus.
* Proficiency in handling large, multi-dimensional datasets (e.g., netCDF, TIFF).
* Strong programming skills in Python, with experience using xarray and a solid understanding of software engineering principles.
* Ability to work independently while effectively collaborating within an Agile team environment.
* Strong multitasking skills with the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously.
* Excellent analytical and problem-solving abilities.
* Strong interpersonal and communication skills.
* Passion for translating climate science into actionable insights for businesses and communities.

## Diversity

A recent study shows that one in every 10 tech workers in Spain are women. Only 8% of all contracts in 2019 with people with disabilities were in technology and science. Meanwhile, 30% of LGTBIQ people in Spain do not come out in the workplace for fear of discrimination.

This is neither the world we want to live in nor the workplace we’re building.

Mitiga is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

In fact, we strongly encourage applicants from minority groups to apply.

## Our offer

Our vision is to be the place where a diverse mix of talented people want to come, to stay and do their best work. Some of our benefits, like unlimited personal time or flexible working arrangements, help work adjust to your life – and not the other way around. You can work from home or come twice a week to our office in the heart of Barcelona. Dogs and other furry friends are welcome!

Our compressed work schedule allows you to work half a day on Fridays during the year (so you can start the weekend early). During the summer, it also allows you to work 4 days a week, so you spend time with your loved ones (or work on your tan). Shadow our leadership and participate in our structured feedback and mentorship programs. If you grow, we grow.
