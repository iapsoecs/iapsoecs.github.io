Position Summary:

Florida Atlantic University is seeking a Postdoctoral Fellow Oceanographic/Environmental Data at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute campus in Fort Pierce, FL. This position will be based in the Geochemical Sensing Lab and the candidate will work closely with Dr. Jordon Beckler, other members of the Geochemical Sensing Lab, and members of other labs involved in related research projects.

The candidate will be involved in a collaborative harmful algal bloom study at Lake Okeechobee and will be responsible for the organization, development, and implementation of a database, associated data visualization products, and processed data products (e.g. statistics and model results).



Summary of responsibilities:

Serve as primary project contact for data-related matters between project partners and agencies.

Ensure all data generated through the project is appropriately archived and disseminated via a designated public data portal.

Coordinate cooperative field trips to collect water, sediment, and soil samples, and to deploy/service autonomous instrumentation, with the opportunity to participate occasionally.

Routinely assist lab members with sample processing following field sample collection, which will involve after-hours work.

Transform data using community standards and best practices.

Develop Data QA/QC Plans, maintain accurate data records, ensure data are compliant with QA standards, and regularly update database.

Process data to construct visualizations and perform statistical analyses. The postdoctoral scientist is expected to report findings in scientific journals and be an active collaborator, essentially leading the data synthesis (modeling will be conducted by other staff members, so this position primarily regards statistical analyses).

Assist with budgeting, literature research, and writing proposals, manuscripts, and reports.

Establish friendly relationship with members of the media to increase project awareness.



Minimum Qualifications:

Ph.D. from an accredited institution in Oceanography, Geochemistry, Chemical Oceanography, Biological Oceanography, Data Science, Library and Information Science, or related area of specialization by time of application required.

Past experience working in oceanographic or environmental research labs on grant-funded projects.

Experience in manipulation of large sets of disparate data. Experience with Matlab, Python, Machine Learning, and/or software development is preferred.

Some lab experience preferred, particularly with water and sediment sample processing.

Excellent project management skills and capable of meeting project deadlines.

Individual must be motivated, organized, and be able to work independently and as part of a team.

Occasional flexible hours are expected, including potential evening and weekend schedules as required for project needs.

A valid Florida driver's license is required or the ability to obtain a Florida driver's license within 30 days.

Ability to lift up to 50 pounds.
