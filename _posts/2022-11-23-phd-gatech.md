I am recruiting new M.S. and Ph.D. students to join my group at Georgia Tech in Fall 2023. Our application deadline is 1 Jan 2023. Interested students should feel free to reach out to me directly (iwb@gatech.edu<mailto:iwb@gatech.edu>) with a CV/resume and a brief (few paragraphs) summary of research interests.

Our group is interested in exploring marine biogeochemical cycling as it relates to the health, structure, and function of coral reefs and coastal ecosystems. We combine a variety of discrete and autonomous sampling of carbonate chemistry, trace metals, and traditional/non-traditional stable isotope measurements from within these environments with quantitative biogeochemical decomposition models and high-resolution mass spectrometry methods to investigate various geochemical proxies that can be used as ?fingerprints? of environmental (and stress-induced) changes in ecosystem health and composition. We are also interested in applying similar approaches to more comprehensively investigate the utility and nuances of coral skeletons as paleoclimate archives in modern and ancient reef ecosystems. Current projects are focused on novel methods development and applications in French Polynesia, the Caribbean Sea, and coastal Georgia, though new field areas are welcome. With all potential projects, we are committed to promoting and developing community-engaged and community-influenced research opportunities that promote resilience and increase geoscience accessibility and diversity.

Students will have access to equipment for high-resolution and/or high-throughput determination of trace metal concentrations and isotope ratios in aqueous solutions and carbonates (Q-ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS with a laser ablation system), determination of carbonate chemistry parameters (total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, etc.), field deployable sensors (CTD, colorimetric pH, oxygen optodes, etc.), and a Class 1000 clean lab for elemental purification. A wide range of additional surface science and microscopy techniques (e.g. Raman, SEM, TEM, etc.) are also available through the shared use Georgia Tech Materials Characterization Facility.

Prior experience with carbonate chemistry sampling, column chromatography, mass spectrometry, snorkeling/diving, numerical biogeochemical modeling, and/or community-engaged environmental science research is a plus. Coding experience in MATLAB, Python, and/or R is preferred.

You can learn more about the School of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech here: https://eas.gatech.edu/graduate/prospective-graduate-students. I am committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and equitable research group, and I encourage students of all backgrounds, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented and minoritized groups in STEM and the geosciences, to reach out with any questions!

Thank you,

Isaiah Bolden
