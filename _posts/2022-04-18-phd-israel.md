Description

We have an open Ph.D. position in small-scale air-sea interactions. The research project focuses on studying the role of the Sea of Galilee in determining climate conditions around the lake. The successful candidate will conduct high-resolution numerical simulations using a regional coupled atmosphere-ocean model and assess its performance against various observations inside, above, and around the lake. An essential part of the project will include the investigation of how horizontal variability in the lake conditions affects the evaporation from the lake and the micro-climate around the lake.

 

Qualification/experience

The ideal candidate will have: (a) A background in atmospheric research, oceanography, computer sciences, or physics; (b) The capability of working in a Linux and HPC environment; (c) Experience in running general circulation models such as the WRF or MITgcm; (d) Good written and oral communication in English; (e) The desire to present the results in international conferences and summarize them in journal publications.

Application

For full consideration, please send a cover letter and CV (including the names and contact details of potential referees) by email before Apr 26, 2022. However, applications will be considered until the position is filled.

 

For more information and/or applying for the position, please contact Udi Strobach at udist@volcani.agri.gov.il.
