We invite applications for a Scientist position in the frame of the Project Coastal Futures - Scenarios to Promote Sustainable Futures of Contested Marine Areas that forms part of the German DAM Research MISSION "Protection and Sustainable Use of Marine Spaces". The project develops, simulates, and explores future human use scenarios and triggered impacts in the North and Baltic Sea and their estuaries, and explores existing protection measures and new management options together with stakeholders from maritime management and industry. Coastal Futures concentrates on climate impacts and anticipated man-made pressures at basin scales from four management sectors: (1) offshore renewable energy production, (2) fisheries, (3) nature-based coastal protection measures and (4) eutrophication originating from terrestrial sources. The position is initially limited to three years.

Equality of opportunity is an important part of our personnel policy. We would therefore strongly encourage qualified women to apply for the position. The position can be filled part-time in principle.

Your tasks:

* further implementation and validation of a flexible coupled (ocean, atmosphere, biogeochemistry, waves) modelling framework for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea
* performance and analysis of coupled climate change and human use scenario simulations, and assessment of uncertainties
Your profile
* a degree (preferably PhD) in oceanography, meteorology, physics, environmental sciences or related disciplines

Severely disabled persons and those equaling severely disabled persons who are equally suitable for the position will be considered preferentially within the framework of legal requirements.
