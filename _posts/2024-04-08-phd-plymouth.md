The University of Plymouth is offering a 5-years Doctoral Teaching Assistant position investigating the role of large-scale climate drivers in coastal evolution.

The project will involve using novel and multidisciplinary approaches to combine statistical downscaling techniques and numerical modelling in different types of coastlines: exposed cross-shore dominated and sheltered alongshore dominated. Tasks will include application of statistical data mining techniques, coastal numerical modelling and the use of field observations for calibration/ validation purposes. 

This is a Doctoral Teaching Assistant position that involves teaching and PhD activities. The position will consist of (i) a part time (0.65 FTE - teaching contract at Grade 6; and (ii) a part-time PhD (0.35 FTE) offered for a 5 year period (covering 4 years of doctoral study plus 1 year writing up).

The successful candidate will become an active member of the internationally recognised University of Plymouth Coastal Processes Research Group (CPRG; https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/coastal-processes) and will participate in a research placement with the Geomatics and Ocean Engineering Group (https://geoocean.unican.es/index.html) at the University of Cantabria (Spain).

Applications close on 24 April and more information as well as the application procedure can be found here:
