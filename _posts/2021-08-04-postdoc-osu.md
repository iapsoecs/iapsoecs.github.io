Two postdoctoral scholar positions for up to 2.5 years are available at Oregon State University’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences in Corvallis, Oregon, under the direction of Dr. Andreas Schmittner.
 
 
Position 1: Ocean Mixing
Effects of (i) internal waves and (ii) mesoscale eddies on ocean mixing will be explored in global climate models. Simulations of the present-day and ice-age oceans will be conducted to assess how mixing affects ocean circulation, climate, and the cycling of biogeochemical tracers.
 
 
Position 2: Ice-Ocean Interactions
A model of the Antarctic ice sheet will be coupled with a climate model of intermediate complexity and used to investigate ice-ocean interactions during the last deglaciation and their impacts on ocean circulation, climate and the cycling of biogeochemical tracers and isotopes.
 
 
Applicants, particularly those from groups that are currently underrepresented in climate modeling, with a Ph.D. in oceanography, climate science, physics or a related field, and experience in numerical modeling are encouraged to apply.
 
 
The position will be open until filled, at least until Sep. 30, 2021.
 
 
Preferable start date: Oct. 2021 – Jan. 2022.
