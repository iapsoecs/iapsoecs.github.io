The Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science (EOAS) at the Florida State University (FSU) invites applications for 3 tenure-track Assistant Professor positions:

(1) Aqueous Trace Element Biogeochemistry/Chemical Oceanography (49933): The ideal candidate will examine the role of trace elements in the oceans or other aquatic environments, their role in biogeochemical cycles, and/or their impact on the biosphere as toxins. This research may include but is not limited to processes within the air-sea interface, water-column, bottom waters, and/or pore fluids. The hire will work in the new (January 2020) EOAS building with a state-of-the-art trace metal lab, as well as with advanced analytical instrumentation (multiple ICP-MS’s and Neptune MC-ICP-MS) at FSU’s National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The appointee is also expected to contribute to the department’s strong commitment to the Oceanography and Environmental Sciences programs.

(2) Earth-Life Interactions (49940):  The ideal candidate will investigate the coevolution of life and environment with potential interests in planetary habitability of Earth and exoplanets, biosignatures for life (radiations and extinctions), and implications for modern climate change. Research areas of interest include but are not limited to: paleobiology, geobiology, extinction dynamics, paleoecology, paleontology, biotic responses to global change, geomicrobiology, and biogeochemistry.

(3) Cloud Microphysics and Aerosols (49937): The ideal candidate will have expertise in cloud microphysics, aerosols, and their impacts on weather, climate, and the environment. The research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, clouds and aerosols, their interactions with each other, representations in models, and impacts on atmospheric radiation, tropical cyclones, extreme weather, atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and the environment.
 
Appointees are expected to teach courses and contribute to both the undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the department and to develop and maintain a vigorous externally funded research program in their specialty area of interest. Candidates must hold a Doctoral degree or the highest degree appropriate in Geosciences or a related field.

EOAS, housed in a new building (2020) with state-of-the-art facilities and laboratories, has approximately 40 faculty members, and 135 graduate students, a diverse student population, and offers undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in Geology, Meteorology, Oceanography, and Environmental Sciences. For additional information on EOAS and FSU’s resources, please check https://www.eoas.fsu.edu/ .

Applicants should submit to the appropriate job opening to https://hr.fsu.edu/working-fsu/prospective-employees/careers-florida-state a cover letter, curriculum vitae, contact information for three references, and statements on research, and teaching interests, and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Review of applications commences November 1, 2021 and will continue until the positions are filled. Women and members of minority groups are especially encouraged to apply.

Inquiries may be addressed to the chairs of the search committees, Prof. Angela Knapp (Aqueous Trace Element Biogeochemistry, anknapp@fsu.edu, opening 49933), Prof. Yang Wang (Earth-life interaction, ywang@magnet.fsu.edu, opening 49940) and Prof. Guosheng Liu (Cloud Microphysics/aerosol interaction, gliu@fsu.edu, opening 49937).

Advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values at FSU and the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science. Our excellence can only be fully realized when we share our commitment to these values.
