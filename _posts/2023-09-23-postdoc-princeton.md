The Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program (https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University (https://www.princeton.edu/), in association with NOAA's (https://www.noaa.gov/) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) (https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/), seeks a postdoctoral or more senior research scientist for research focused on coupled high-resolution atmosphere-wave-ocean models and their implementation for simulating coastal storm events and impacts.

The scientist will collaborate with GFDL researchers to enhance and analyze a high-resolution regional coupled model system that utilizes NOAA's state-of-the-art SHiELD (https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/shield/) atmospheric model, MOM6 (https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/mom-ocean-model/) ocean model, and WAVEWATCH III (https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/wavewatch/) wave model.  This project will emphasize research that targets understanding the role of small-scale (<10km) coupled air-sea interactions and boundary layer processes in the development of coastal weather systems and storm events.  The project will also emphasize understanding the societal risks associated with coastal storm events including the ability to simulate precipitation patterns and coastal plains flooding events.  The selected candidate will join a vigorous research group at Princeton University, working in close collaboration with Drs. Brandon Reichl and Lucas Harris at NOAA/GFDL.  The individual will have access to state-of-the-art numerical models and high-performance computing systems at Princeton and NOAA, working alongside GFDL model developers to advance capabilities for high-resolution coupled regional modeling.

Candidates must have a Ph.D. in atmospheric science, physical oceanography, applied math, the physical sciences, or a closely related field.  The following attributes are desirable: (a) a background in coupled air-sea interactions and atmosphere/ocean boundary layer processes; (b) experience in using advanced coupled atmosphere-ocean models; (c) experience in developing numerical models in collaborative environments; (d) excellent written, oral, and visual communication skills, demonstrated through prior peer-reviewed publications and presentations at major conferences; and (e) experience with software development and analysis tools, such as Git, SVN, Linux, Bash/Csh, Python, Fortran, NetCDF, Pangeo, Jupyter, and/or Matlab.  Prior experience with the MOM6 and/or SHiELD models is desirable but not required.  Initial appointments are for one year, with renewal for up to two additional years based on satisfactory performance and available funding.

Princeton is interested in candidates who, through their research, will contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community.  Applicants should apply online at https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/32003. Complete applications will include a CV, publication and presentation list, 3 letters of recommendation, and a one-to-two page research statement. Review of applications will begin October 31, 2023, and continue until the position is filled. For additional information, contact Brandon Reichl (brandon.reichl@noaa.gov) or Lucas Harris (lucas.harris@noaa.gov).
