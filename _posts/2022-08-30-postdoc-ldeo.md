The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University located in Palisades, New York, invites applications for 1-2 Postdoctoral Research Scientist positions on tropical dynamics and tropical cyclones. This research project studies forced trends in the tropical Pacific and global tropical cyclones. Specifically, we aim to investigate the physical processes through which the common equatorial Pacific cold tongue biases in GCMs influence the models’ projections of the mean state climate and global TC activity, quantify the influence, and develop novel projections of global TC activity based on appropriate bias corrections. Responsibilities include: Conduct numerical experiments using global climate models, analyze modeling results, lead peer-reviewed journal articles, and present the research results at conferences. The postdoc will be based at LDEO working with Profs. Chia-Ying Lee, Suzana Camargo, Adam Sobel, and Richard Seager. The postdoc will closely interact with our collaborators at Stoney Brook University, Mississippi State University, and Lawrence Berkeley lab. Candidates should have completed or be nearing completion of a PhD in Atmospheric sciences, Physics or related disciplines. Research experience in conducting global climate model simulations is preferred but is not necessary. 

Proposed start date is November 1st 2022, with some flexibility. Appointment will be initially for one year, with the possibility of renewal for up to three years, subject to satisfactory performance. 

This search will remain open for at least 30 days after the ad appears and will continue until the position is filled.
