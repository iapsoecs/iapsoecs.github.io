The Coastal Climate group of the Institute of Coastal Systems at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon in Geesthacht, near Hamburg, Germany, invites applications for an exciting 32 months Postdoc position. The aim is to improve our understanding of coastal extreme events and of our ability to make forecasts and projections. The position is part of the 3rd DAM research mission “Marine Extreme Events and Natural Hazards” starting January 1st, 2024. Within the research mission, a large network of research institutions in Germany is working on the common goal of investigating interactions between short-term, multiple, and cascading extreme events and natural hazards, as well as their long-term impacts on marine ecosystems and coastal human life.

Equal opportunity is an important part of our personnel policy. We would therefore strongly encourage qualified women to apply for the position. In principle, the full time position (39 h/week) is also sharable.

Your tasks

The sub-project of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon will focus on highly topical machine learning approaches with the objective to develop and implement such approaches for the generation of shortest-term forecasts of extreme wind-generated waves and for downscaling atmospheric seasonal forecasts and climate projections to coastal extremes. The overall goal is to develop, together with partners, impact-based forecasting approaches of coastal extremes.

Your profile

    - University degree in computer science, mathematics, physics or earth system sciences (e.g., oceanography, meteorology or geophysics) with a Master's degree
    - PhD highly desirable
    - good knowledge of data analysis, statistics, and machine learning approaches
    - strong interest in coastal research and extreme events experience in a higher programming language
    - ability to communicate effectively in spoken and written English
    - strong motivation, also to publish in peer-reviewed journals and to present scientific results at international conferences
    - German language skills are an advantage

We offer you

    - an exciting and varied job in a research centre with more than 1,000 employees from around 60 nations
    - a well-connected research campus and best networking opportunities
    - individual opportunities for further training
    - social benefits according to the collective agreement of the public service and remuneration
    - an excellent technical infrastructure and modern workplace equipment
    - 6 weeks holiday per year; company holidays between Christmas and New Year's Day
    - very good compatibility of private and professional life through offers of mobile and flexible work
    - family-friendly company policy with childcare facilities, e.g. nursery close to the company
    - free assistance program for employees (EAP) Corporate Benefits
