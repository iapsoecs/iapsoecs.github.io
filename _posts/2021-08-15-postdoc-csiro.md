**Postdoctoral Fellowship in coastal climate modelling at CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia**

https://jobs.csiro.au/job/Hobart%2C-TAS-CSIRO-Postdoctoral-Fellowship-in-Coastal-Climate-Modelling/772293800/?from=email&refid=6071594900&utm_source=J2WEmail&source=2&eid=17800-202103300603-12622695300&locale=en_GB
 
**The Opportunity**

    Do you have a PhD in physical or biogeochemical oceanography and environmental modelling or applied fluid dynamics?
    Do you want to help build strategies to optimise ecosystem health in the decades to come?
    Join CSIRO & contribute to the goal of “unlocking climate intelligence”! 

CSIRO Early Research Career (CERC) Postdoctoral Fellowships provide opportunities to scientists and engineers who have completed their doctorate and have less than three years of relevant postdoctoral work experience. These fellowships aim to develop the next generation of future leaders of the innovation system.

The Postdoctoral Fellow will develop predictions of future marine conditions in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), at a scale relevant to ecological responses. They will be responsible for downscaling global climate predictions using a coastal model of the GBR and exploring local impacts accounting for the critical climatic threats (warming, acidification, changes in circulation, pollution).  The Postdoctoral Fellow will work as part of a collaborative and multidisciplinary modelling team: from hydrodynamic to biogeochemical and connectivity modelling, from small scale and tidal dynamics to basin scale climate signals, and from coral bleaching to ocean acidification. 

**Your duties will include:**

    In collaboration with the modelling team, downscale future climate patterns to explore local impacts on the Great Barrier Reef
    Design and analyse numerical experiments to investigate the reef-scale effects of climate change at the resolution to inform effective management of the coastal area
    Effectively use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) facilities and technologies for model simulations and analysis of the outputs.
    Produce high quality scientific papers suitable for publication in high impact journals.

Location:   Hobart, TAS, Australia

Salary:  AU$88k - AU$96k plus up to 15.4% superannuation

Tenure:  Specified term of 3 years

Reference:   75269

**To be considered you will need:**

    A doctorate (or will shortly satisfy the requirements of a PhD) in a relevant discipline area, such as physical or biogeochemical oceanography and environmental modelling or applied fluid dynamics. Please note: To be eligible for this role you must have no more than 3 years (or part-time equivalent) of postdoctoral research experience.
    Experience in the development and/or interpretation of numerical models of the ocean and the analysis of large and complex oceanographic data sets.
    Experience in working in a Linux/UNIX computing environment and a high level of programming skills in languages such as FORTRAN, C, Python and MATLAB. 
    Demonstrated high level written and oral communication skills with the ability to represent the research team effectively, including the presentation of research outcomes at national and international conferences and to policy and decision makers.
