# Operational Oceanographer - NOW Systems

We are looking for a junior professional with a background in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) who is eager to build a career in operational oceanography. The ideal candidate will have a strong interest in developing and running the operational suites that support our ocean forecasting services. While this is an entry-level position, any relevant experience is a strong plus.

As a permanent, full-time member of our Operations Team, you will play an important part in delivering our operational services for the Copernicus Marine framework. Your role will also involve collaboration on a diverse range of R&D projects and coastal services, offering a solid opportunity to grow within a dynamic environment.

# About NOW Systems

NOW Systems -Nologin Oceanic Weather Systems-, is the environmental branch of Nologin Consulting, a Spanish technological SME established in the year 2000 that actively works with companies around the world, helping them on the digital transformation with a complete value proposition, including development and deployment of innovative structural solutions. Since 2022, NOW Systems, as a specialized SME, has been delivering science-based operational services to enhance our knowledge of the past, present, and future state of the ocean. As a dedicated ocean service provider, NOW Systems develops and implements technical solutions that promote more efficient, informed, and sustainable activities and decision-making in support of the Blue Economy.

NOW Systems is a Copernicus Marine Service provider, co-leading the Iberia-Biscay-Ireland Monitoring and Forecasting Centre (IBI-MFC) with Mercator Océan International. Within this IBI-MFC framework, NOW is the operational provider of this regional service, being responsible for the delivery and validation of operational ocean products for the European Atlantic façade. These products are generated through advanced model applications for ocean circulation, waves, and biogeochemistry. In addition, NOW leads the newly established Copernicus Marine COLAB-MFC initiative, which focuses on integrating non-European operational ocean forecasting products in the Copernicus Marine Service catalogue. Beyond Copernicus Marine regional services, NOW also delivers tailored coastal solutions, by integrating data from multiple sources -including near-real-time monitoring and high-resolution coastal forecasting systems- to support the development of operational early warning systems.

# About the job

We are seeking a motivated Ocean Software Developer to join our team supporting NOW Systems' operational ocean forecasting services. Your primary focus will be running and monitoring the operational suites for the IBI-MFC and COLAB-MFC Copernicus Marine services.

In this role, you will also support the Copernicus Marine Service Desk activities for our operational ocean products and contribute to developing dashboards for service-oriented solutions. You will thrive in a multidisciplinary environment, collaborating with a dynamic team to develop cutting-edge operational oceanographic applications.

 

# Key responsibilities

* Execute the daily operational suites for ocean physical, biogeochemical, and wave models.
* Acquire and preprocess input data for operational suites, including atmospheric forcing, boundary conditions, and observations for data assimilation and model validation.
* Generate and process ocean data products for delivery to the Copernicus Marine Service.
* Monitor and control suite performance using dedicated tools (e.g., Grafana).
* Manage and respond to incidents that occur during daily operations.
* Collaborate with the Operations Team to resolve incidents, including code debugging, suite corrections, and implementing temporary patches.
* Handle Service Desk tasks, including communicating with the Copernicus Marine Central Service Desk, interacting with users, and liaising with scientific teams.
* Prepare and maintain technical documentation for all operational suites.

 

# Required Skills & Qualifications

* Degree in Engineering, a scientific discipline (such as Geophysics, Physics or Mathematics), or a related field.
* Strong programming and scripting skills in Python and shell.
* Proficiency with version control tools, particularly Git.
* Fundamental knowledge of oceanography and experience with common ocean data formats (e.g., NetCDF).
* Fluency in English (written and spoken).

 

# Preferred Skills & Experience

* Experience with Python numerical libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Xarray.
* Previous experience running operational forecasting systems (ocean, meteorological, or climate).
* Experience in ocean modeling.
* Experience working in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments.
* Experience with Service Desk operations and ticketing tools (e.g., JIRA).
* Knowledge of Spanish.

 

# Ideal Candidate Profile

You are a meticulous, creative, and collaborative individual eager to contribute to an ambitious international project. You thrive as a team player and are passionate about advancing the pan-European Copernicus Marine Service.

 

# What we offer 

Join us and become part of a vibrant, collaborative community. You will work in a highly multidisciplinary setting, collaborating closely with our internal team, as well as with scientific and technical experts from the Copernicus Marine Service, coastal service providers, and leading researchers.

This position is based at our Madrid office and operates on a hybrid model.
