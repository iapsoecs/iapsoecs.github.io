The work will involve close collaboration with scientists at NOAA's
Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), and
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). The applicant will be
physically stationed at AOML in Miami, FL.


The principal objective of the position will be to conduct and analyze a
suite of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) model simulations to understand
the efficacy, processes and impacts associated with this Carbon Dioxide
Removal (CDR) method. The incumbent will leverage GFDL's existing 1/2
degree fully-coupled Earth System Model (ESM4.1) to perform idealized
site-specific OAE simulations, as well as ocean alkalinization simulations
following the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (CDRMIP)
protocols. Analyses will involve interpreting and analyzing large data sets
from model simulations to assess and evaluate ocean biogeochemical
responses and ecosystem impacts on various ocean and coastal areas,
including determining the magnitude and timescales of carbon dioxide uptake
and the potential to reduce the rate and impacts of ocean acidification.
Personnel will interact with active groups at AOML and GFDL studying the
carbon cycle, and connections between biogeochemistry, ecosystems, and
climate.


Duties include but are not limited to:

- Conduct and analyze marine alkalinization Earth System Model simulations
to investigate underlying mechanisms and processes, and quantify responses.
- Explore impacts of OAE on climate, oceans, coasts, and marine ecosystems
using outputs from numerical simulations.
- Evaluate model data from GFDL-ESM4.1 CDRMIP OAE simulations against
publicly available data from similar CMIP6 CDRMIP simulations.
- Present findings at scientific meetings and publish results in
peer-reviewed journals.
- Active participation in scientific discussions with colleagues and in CDR
related working groups or forums.


Minimum Qualifications

- Applicants must have a Ph.D. in oceanography or a related field, and a
background in ocean biogeochemical research at the post-doctoral level.
- Necessary skills include experience with climate modeling, the ability to
analyze and organize large datasets or model outputs, knowledge of
Unix/Linux, and experience with commonly used software and protocols in the
oceanographic community including MatLab, Ferret, and/or Python.
- The incumbent must have a proven publication record, strong scientific
writing and computer skills, and the ability to communicate science to
diverse audiences and stakeholders.
- The successful candidate must be able to work collaboratively within a
diverse and dynamic team, as well as demonstrate the ability to work
independently to complete complex interdisciplinary analyses across fields
including climate dynamics, and ocean and coastal biogeochemistry.


Applications should include curriculum vitae, a cover letter stating
research interest, experiences and the contact information for three
professional references.
