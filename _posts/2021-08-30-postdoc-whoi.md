The department of Physical Oceanography at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is seeking a Postdoctoral Investigator. This is a full-time position and is eligible for benefits. The initial appointment will be for one year with the possibility of an extension for an additional year based on satisfactory performance.

JOB SUMMARY:

Research will involve studying three-dimensional Lagrangian motion in eddies and fronts and its  biogeochemical implications. The postdoc will be expected to participate in ship-based fieldwork, in analyzing observations, and using three-dimensional modeling for process understanding. The project offers scope to explore ocean submesoscale dynamics, microbial planktonic distributions, and will further understanding of pathways for subduction from the upper ocean, It is funded by ONR, is an international collaboration and involves several PIs. The postdoc will play a key role in the design and execution of research and the interpretation of scientific results.

The institution has a top-rated postdoctoral program (www.whoi.edu/postdoctoral/) that supports a thriving postdoctoral community with formal mentoring and career guidance programs. While the primary focus is research, the postdoctoral investigator will have an opportunity to participate in educational and outreach activities associated with the project.

EDUCATION & EXPERIENCE DESIRED:

PhD
Knowledge of physical oceanography
Strong computer and programming skills, numerical modeling, data analysis and visualization. Demonstrated ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively.
Interest in making measurements at sea is a plus
Interest in physical-biological interactions is a plus
