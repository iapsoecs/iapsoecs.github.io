The research unit Ocean Dynamics at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany is looking for a 

Postdoctoral researcher 
to work on the role of eddies in the Southern Ocean 
starting as soon as possible.

We seek an individual excited about climate science and modelling, keen to investigate Southern Ocean and eddy mixing processes in a warming climate. The position focuses on understanding the role of mesoscale eddies in (i) redistribution of meltwater, (ii) uptake of heat and trace gases, and (iii) propagation of climate signals across fronts in the Southern Ocean. The key tool to address these topics is a global climate model with a regionally refined ocean grid simulating an eddy-rich Southern Ocean. By addressing the above topics the postdoctoral researcher will contribute to the overarching BMBF-funded project PalMod II “From the Last Interglacial to the Anthropocene – Modeling a Complete Glacial Cycle”.

Your responsibilities:

• running numerical experiments with an established global climate model 

• configuring a regionally refined Southern Ocean

• conducting original research with this model analyzing large data sets

• interpreting and publishing the research in international journals


This is a full time position available for a funding period until January 31, 2023.
Please send your application via e-mail with "PalMod2 ocean eddies” in the subject line not later than March 15, 2020 to bewerbung@geomar.de
