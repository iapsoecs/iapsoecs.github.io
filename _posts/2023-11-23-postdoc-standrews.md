Two 2-year(+) postdoc positions are open as part of a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship at the University of St Andrews. Broadly, the postdocs will work on the dynamics and variability of the ocean circulation and its effect on biogeochemical cycles and climate, with a particular focus on the high-latitude oceans.
