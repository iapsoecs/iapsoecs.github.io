The Ocean Dynamics research unit at GEOMAR (Kiel, Germany) has an open Research Scientist position for ocean modelling and ocean dynamics for 3+3 years with prospect of tenure.

Scientific foci of the working group are, among others, i) the circulation in the Atlantic, Pacific, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, ii) the global relevance of oceanic eddies, turbulence, and upwelling, iii) the interaction of different physical processes und their role in ocean mixing, iv) scale interactions between ocean and atmosphere, and v) the role of the oceans in the climate system.

The scientist will contribute within the framework of the programme-oriented funding of the Helmholtz Association and as part of a motivated, interdisciplinary team to current research topics in theoretical and physical oceanography and will also set own priorities. Furthermore, the scientist will participate in the continuous development of the scientific foci and in the strategic alignment of the working group. One relevant aspect is the advancement of the ocean and climate modelling strategy and infrastructure within the research unit and at GEOMAR in general.
