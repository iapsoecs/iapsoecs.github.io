The Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science Department at MIT is seeking to fill a postdoctoral position within the Climate Modelling Alliance (CliMA), a multi-disciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and applied mathematicians, spanning MIT, Caltech, NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Naval Postgraduate School. The postdoctoral scholar will contribute to the development of a data-informed Earth System Model by building and prototyping numerical and computational methods for an ocean dynamical core that is scalable and adaptable to emerging hardware architectures. We prefer the candidate to have experience with ocean modeling, high-performance parallel computing, and the Julia computing language. We strongly encourage women and under-represented minorities to apply. 

A press release on this initiative provides more information about the overall goals of the project. For more information about the positions, please contact Raffaele Ferrari and John Marshall at earthmachine@mit.edu.

Job Requirements: Ph.D., in applied mathematics, atmospheric or oceanic sciences, computer science, engineering, physics, statistics, or a related field by the date of hire. Strong physical, mathematical, and computational background. Experience with programming in at least one general purpose language and parallel computing. Demonstrated effective written and verbal communication skills.
