We have a position a vacancy for a postdoc position in climate dynamics at the Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen. The position is for a fixed-term period of 4 years. It is associated to the Bjerknes Climate Prediction Unit at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research.


About the project/work tasks:

The postdoc will contribute to the EU H2020 NextGEMS (subject to the signature of grant agreement) and JPI Climate EUREC4A-OA projects. NextGEMS is an ambitious project to develop and apply a new generation of Storm-Resolving Earth System Models (SR-ESMs) to study climate variability and change. The SR-ESMS will have 3 km horizontal resolutions in ocean and atmosphere, and so will resolve meso- and sub-mesoscale ocean-atmosphere interactions. EUREC4A-OA (<http://eurec4a-oa.eu>) is an exciting project that aims to improve the representation of small-scale nonlinear ocean-atmosphere interactions in climate models by innovative joint observing and modelling approaches.


The postdoc will assess the representation of air-sea interaction in SR-ESMs through detailed analysis of high-resolution observations and model simulations. The aim is to understand the importance of such fine-scale air-sea interactions in the tropics for simulating and predicting climate. The postdoc will interact with model developers at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Alfred Wegener Institute, and ECMWF. The postdoc will support UiBâ€™s role in leading a work package in the NextGEMS project and this will include helping to organizing a model application hackathon.


Application deadline: 28.04
