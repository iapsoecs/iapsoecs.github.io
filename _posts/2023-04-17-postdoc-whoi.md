My research group in the biology department at WHOI is looking for a
postdoc to help develop new numerical ecosystem models of the Northwest
Atlantic. The model will apply cutting edge trait-based eco-physiology
to parameterize planktonic growth and interspecific interactions,
focusing on the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf and slope waters.
The model will build from the 'Darwin' ecosystem model developed at MIT,
including collaboration with MIT and UC Santa Cruz researchers.
Scientific goals of the project include characterization of primary and
secondary production, assimilation and/or validation with chemical and
biological data, and targeted simulations to support regional ecosystem
and fisheries management. This is a great opportunity to dig into a
regional ecosystem and build numerical tools that can be used for a
variety of basic and applied science questions. The position can be
based in Woods Hole, Boston, or remote from within the US. More info
