The Krause and Kiel Reese Laboratories at the University of South Alabama and Dauphin Island Sea Lab are seeking a full-time PhD (Graduate Research Assistant) to examine bacterial roles in sediment biogeochemical cycling. The student will participate in two field campaigns in the Gulf of Mexico; additional field opportunities are possible. On-the-job training for specific niche responsibilities will be provided (e.g. particle analysis, isotope tracer methods) and prior experience in molecular approaches (RNA/DNA extraction, purification, library preparation, etc.), informatics, and biogeochemical analysis are a plus. Students will be enrolled in the Marine Science Ph.D. program at the Stokes School of Marine and Environmental Sciences at the University of South Alabama, and work both at the University and the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Stipend ($25000 annually), health insurance, and tuition are included. The preferred start is May-June 2024.
