The Department of Marine Sciences at UConn is now welcoming applications for the 2023 Bucklin Scholars Program (https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarinesciences.uconn.edu%2Fann-bucklin-scholars-program%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7C53317cf6dfd8421318e008dac338aa4b%7C17f1a87e2a254eaab9df9d439034b080%7C0%7C0%7C638036945410492800%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=IOMXm6C5t0UnK1uSXNywb0dIE6JGDuJwjx6auBx3gps%3D&reserved=0) supporting post-doctoral diversity in marine sciences and oceanography.



The Bucklin Scholars Program aims to encourage and support postdoctoral scholars from marginalized and under-represented groups who seek to pursue academic careers in marine sciences.  This competitive program supports one new scholar annually (starting salary ~$65k).  Additional support/resources for research activities, conference travel, etc. are provided by the Scholar's Faculty Sponsor(s).  Applicants work with their proposed Faculty Sponsor(s) to design research and professional development plans.



A key feature of the program is that Scholars are appointed at the rank of Assistant Research Professor, which enables them to submit proposals from DMS for extramural funding as a principal investigator (PI). This is not a tenure-track position.
