Postdoctoral Investigator
Regional Ocean Modeling and Data Assimilation
 
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) invites applications for a Postdoctoral Investigator (PDI) in regional ocean modeling, data-assimilation, and observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs), with a focus on the Northwest Atlantic (NWA) Ocean. The successful candidate will be supervised by Drs. Ke Chen, Weifeng (Gordon) Zhang, and Gregory Britten as part of Ocean Vital Signs Network (OVSN) initiative at WHOI. The OVSN is a coordinated sensing system designed to quantitatively assess the health and carbon cycle of the oceans and marine life by integrating persistent in-water sensing, data and communication infrastructure, and advanced estimation and analysis pipelines. The PDI will be responsible for assessing challenges in existing physical-biogeochemical models in the NWA region, developing a skillful regional circulation model, and conducting data assimilation and OSSEs to contribute to the design of the OVSN system.
 
The ideal candidate will have strong numerical modeling experience and quantitative skills. Experience with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is preferred but not required. A general understanding of the interactions between physical and biogeochemical/biological processes is desirable, as the PDI will collaborate with a team of interdisciplinary experts. Strong oral and written communication skills, preferably demonstrated through publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presentations, are also required. The initial appointment is one year. Renewal of the appointment is conditional on the PDI making satisfactory progress during the prior year and continuation of funding. This is a full-time position with full benefits (https://www.whoi.edu/website/HR/benefits).
 
WHOI is situated in the village of Woods Hole, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, approximately 1.5 hours driving south of Boston. WHOI has approximately 1200 full-time employees and students engaged in oceanographic research and education. WHOI is co-located in Woods Hole with the University of Chicago Marine Biological Laboratory, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, USGS Coastal and Marine Science Center, and Woodwell Climate Research Center, driving a vibrant marine research community.
 
WHOI has a top-rated postdoctoral program (www.whoi.edu/postdoctoral/) that supports a dynamic postdoctoral community with formal mentoring and career guidance programs. While the primary focus of the work will be in research, the Postdoctoral Investigator will have opportunities to participate in educational and outreach activities associated with the project.
 
WHOI is committed to scientific excellence and diversity, and we strongly encourage applications from candidates who will contribute to a culturally diverse and inclusive environment. Applications from minority-serving institutions and historically Black colleges and universities are particularly encouraged.
 

Qualified applicants should submit a cover letter, CV, up to three relevant publications, and names/contact information for at least three professional references. Please apply online at
