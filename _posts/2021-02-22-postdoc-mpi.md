The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) is a multidisciplinary centre for climate research located in Hamburg, Germany. It has an internationally recognised reputation in climate modelling. The MPI-M is located in the heart of one of Europe's most liveable and vibrant cities. It provides a highly international and interdisciplinary environment for conducting scientific research as well as access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities.

In the department The Atmosphere in the Earth System, we are looking for a

Postdoctoral Scientist (f/m/div – W086)

to conduct research on ocean-atmosphere coupling. The goal of the project is to investigate the effect of ocean diurnal warm layers on atmospheric convection. The successful candidate will use the next-generation atmosphere-ocean model ICON, developed at MPI Hamburg, that allows to explicitly resolve on large domains both convection in the atmosphere and thin diurnal warm layers in the ocean. He/She will be part of the collaborative research center TRR181 “Energy Transfers in Atmosphere and Ocean” (www.trr-energytransfers.de) funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The investigations will be conducted in close collaboration with the Leibniz-Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde (IOW).

Responsibilities

·         Perform coupled simulations with the ICON model using decimeter-scale resolution in the ocean and atmosphere

·         Evaluate the simulations against recent field observations (EUREC4A)

·         Investigate the effect of diurnal warm layers on atmospheric convection

·         Disseminate the results through high quality peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences

Qualifications/Experience

·         A PhD in applied mathematics, meteorology, oceanography, physics, or a related field is required for this position

·         Very good English language skills are mandatory

·         Strong programming skills; experience in working with atmospheric or fluid dynamic models is of advantage

·         An ability to work independently

·         An ability to effectively communicate the results within the project and to outside colleagues as well as the ability to publish in international journals, the latter demonstrated by at least one first author publication in a recognized scientific journal.

 

 

Employment conditions

·         The initial appointment is until 31.12.2023. The starting date is as soon as possible.

·         Payment will be in accordance with German public service positions (TVoeD E14), including extensive social security plans. The conditions of employment, including upgrades and duration, follow the rules of the Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Sciences and those of the German civil service.

·         The Max Planck Society strives for gender and diversity equality. We welcome applications from all backgrounds.

·         Handicapped persons with comparable qualifications receive preferential status.
