Researcher / Research Engineer - Oceanography (2 positions)

NIVA's Section for Oceanography works from satellites to the deepest oceans, and addresses questions related to light, trace metals, and nutrients to ecosystems. We work all the way from small datasets to "Big Data" as well as modelling of the world's oceans. The group has been very successful in recent years with projects funded by the Research Council of Norway, Norwegian Environmental Agency, and the European Commission. The projects are related to a large variety of fields, for example; ocean observing using remote sensing and ships of opportunity, impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on marine ecosystems, research and monitoring related to phytoplankton (and harmful algae), and land-ocean interactions and effects in fjords/coastal zones.

Place of work will be either in NIVA's head office in Oslo or in NIVA's Regional Branch Offices in Bergen and Grimstad.

In order to further develop NIVA's research activities within oceanography, we have vacancies for 2-3 research scientists/research engineers:

Assignments: The assignments are related to several activities and tasks, such as:
- Participate in, and lead research activities and projects related to marine biogeochemistry, phytoplankton ecology, sensor development and ocean observing technologies.
- Perform field work including, research cruises, on ships of opportunity, recipient investigations, and/or monitoring.
- Data handling, interpretation, analysis, and modeling.
- Proposal writing to acquire projects and external funding.
- Publish/disseminate research in peer-reviewed journals.
- The position involves international travelling and field trips at sea.

Competences: We are seeking candidates with a PhD (Oceanography, Earth Sciences, Biology, Chemistry, Physics) or Masters (Engineering or other).

- The right candidates have at least 3-5 years of experience within one or more of the following fields:
marine biogeochemistry and marine sciences, oceanography, marine ecology, phytoplankton, molecular techniques, recipient investigations, marine sensors and instrumentation, ocean and ecological modeling, data processing and database management, and programming (Matlab, R, Python).
- Experience from research projects, field work, and project management will be valued.
- For research scientists, in addition: postdoc experience and good track record with respect to external funding acquisition and peer-reviewed publications.
- For engineers, in addition: technical know-how related to hardware and software aspects of designing, developing, and maintaining oceanographic sensors and autonomous observing platforms.
- Ability to communicate easily in English, both verbally and in writing is obligatory. Some understanding of Norwegian (or other Nordic language) will be an advantage.

Personal skills: We are looking for candidates who are innovative and show good initiative in terms of involvement in existing projects and initiating and acquiring new projects. The right candidates find motivation from working in an interdisciplinary scientific research environment covering a broad spectrum of topics.  In addition, cooperativeness, flexibility and ability to work in a team as well as independently are important skills.
