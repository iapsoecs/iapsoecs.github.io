We have a permanent researcher position available in the field of ice
sheet modelling at NORCE and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research
(Bergen, Norway).

The first 2 years of the position are funded through the research
projects IMPOSE and GREASE supported by the Norwegian Research
Council. The work will therefore initially focus on supporting these
two projects with research on Greenland ice sheet evolution under
various future warming scenarios. We expect the researcher to develop
and be involved in other ice sheet â€“ climate projects after these 2
years.

We are looking for an excellent candidate with a background in
(coupled) ice sheet and climate modelling. A PhD is required, or at
least the doctoral thesis needs to have been submitted prior to the
application deadline.

Application deadline: 15 May 2022.
