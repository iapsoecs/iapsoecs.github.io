The Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde (IOW) offers two positions in ocean modelling. The applicants are expected to do run simulations on climate change effects in the Baltic Sea and investigate the results.
 
The PhD student position is about "Major Baltic Inflows", sporadic events transporting saline North Sea water into the Baltic Sea, and their relation to other environmental variables that may change in the future. It starts as soon as possible.
The Postdoc position is about attribution of changes in the ecosystem to human impact, such as climate change and overfertilization, including the question how extreme events like heat waves influence the ecosystem. It starts on December 1st.

Both positions are limited to three years. Please apply until October 15th!

Our interdisciplinary institute is located directly at the beach in Warnemünde, a popular seaside resort which belongs to the city of Rostock (200.000 inhabitants). Rostock with its university is a lively city and offers a lot of free-time possibilities and still quite affordable housing. A direct train takes 2 hours to Berlin and 2.5 hours to its new airport.
