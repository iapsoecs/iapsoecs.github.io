We are recruiting a fully-funded PhD student in the Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University, Sweden. The expected PhD student will work on the role of air-sea-ice interactions on mesoscale cyclones in Polar oceans.

Polar lows, which is also called Arctic hurricanes, are intense mesoscale cyclones over high-latitude oceans. They pose considerable risk to the Arctic activities. However, polar lows are hard to be predicated by todayâ€™s forecast models due to their small scale and short life. Many air-wave-sea-ice interaction processes are important for the polar low development, however, they are poorly understood and represented in the forecast models. This limits our understanding and leads to the poor prediction skill of polar lows. Based on a state-of-the-art atmosphere-wave-ocean-ice coupled system, the role of atmosphere-wave-ocean-ice coupling process on the development of polar lows will be investigated in this project.

In addition, the PhD student has the opportunity to take part in the teaching activities at Uppsala University.
