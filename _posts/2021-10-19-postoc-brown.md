Brown University is searching for a research-minded Postdoctoral Research Associate
to join the Brown Polar Oceanography Group <http://brownpog.com> and the Scale
Aware Sea Ice Project <https://sasip-climate.github.io/>'s efforts to
understand polar change.

The scientist will join a growing cohort of polar scientists and
oceanographers at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society
<https://ibes.brown.edu/>.  A successful applicant will design and evaluate
new parameterizations of ocean and wave-driven mixing in oceans under sea
ice, using continuum climate models, discrete element sea ice models, or
high-resolution large-eddy simulations.

The position will be directly supported by a broad team, including a
research scientist at Brown's Center for Computation and Visualization, a
second postdoctoral researcher at Brown, and project collaborators in
Norway, France, and New Zealand as well as Brown faculty. The applicant
selected will have leeway for scientific exploration and self-directed
research, especially with collaborators within IBES and in other units at
Brown.

The position salary is $62,500 for two years, with the possibility of
extension up to 5. Hosting or traveling to research visits will be
supported, though not required, and remote or flexible working arrangements
may be possible depending on your state of residence. The proposed start
date is 1/1/22, though there is some flexibility. Significant additional
research, computing, and travel support is allocated to facilitate this
work ($7,000/yr), along with relocation support.

Apply at apply.interfolio.com/95128 with a CV, 1 page cover letter/research
statement, and contact information for three references. All
applications received before November 1 will be considered together. The
position will remain open until filled.
