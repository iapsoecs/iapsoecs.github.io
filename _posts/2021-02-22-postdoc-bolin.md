We are pleased to advertised a two-year postdoctoral fellow position at Stockholm University, Bolin Centre for Climate Research and the Department of Geological Sciences, with application deadline 31 March 2021.

 

The successful candidate will work on understanding the Arctic ocean circulation and cryosphere during the Last Interglacial period, using relatively high resolution coupled climate modelling (with the EC-Earth general circulation model). The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world, in large because of the positive feedback of the sea-ice albedo. Adaption to sea-level rise and anticipation of the impacts on Arctic and global ocean circulation is hindered by uncertainty in the contribution from the shrinking Greenland ice-sheet (GIS). To gain a better understanding of the stability of the GIS and the Arctic sea-ice, scientists have turned to the Last Interglacial (LIG) as the last period significantly warmer than today. While forcing mechanisms for the LIG and modern/future warmth are different, i.e. the LIG was forced by different solar insolation, compared to higher greenhouse gas concentrations in the future, important lessons can be gained from understanding the process and impacts of warming on Arctic systems. The problem is that, despite significant attention in the past, current data and models paint a conflicting picture of the LIG Arctic cryosphere (both the sea ice and GIS), implying major gaps in our understanding of the physical process at play. The successful applicant will work as a part of an inter-disciplinary team of experts on paleoclimate modelling, paleoclimate data, and future climate modelling to make step change progress on this question. The project will work closely together with another project that evaluates the Arctic circulation and sea-ice during water interglacials using temperature and sea-ice proxies and plankton taxonomy.

 

Applicants are expected to have a doctoral degree oceanography, meteorology, applied mathematics or similar relevant to the project and have completed this no longer than 3 years before the deadline of the application.
