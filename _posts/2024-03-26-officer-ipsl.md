We are looking for a science officer to coordinate the scientific activities of the national climate modelling research infrastructure (CLIMERI-France) and develop its European dimension (ENES-RI). The scientific coordination tasks will enable national and European climate modelling activities to be consolidated and enhanced, in an international context of producing reference simulations, sharing data from numerical simulations and sharing skills around software. The work will be carried out in close interaction between the involved research teams (in France and Europe for the ENES-RI part) and the CLIMERI-France  research infrastructure management team.
