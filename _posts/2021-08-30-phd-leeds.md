If you are interested in studying ice sheets or sea ice using
satellite and meteorological data, we are currently advertising 2 PhD
positions. The projects are fully funded and based in the Centre for
Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds. Both
projects suit candidates with experience of scientific programming or
satellite data processing.

The ice sheet project aims to investigate ice dynamical imbalance, and
the sea ice project aims to explore trends in Arctic sea ice thickness
and volume. Both projects will combine satellite altimetry and
meteorological data. To support your studies, we will provide training
in Earth Observation as well as academic writing, presentation skills,
and science communication.
