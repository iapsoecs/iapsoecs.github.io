We are excited to announce an opening for a post-doctoral position within the Climate Processes and Predictability Group and the Oceans and Climate Group at the University of Colorado Boulder's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.

The research focus of this project centers on enhancing our understanding of coupled air-sea interaction processes over the Tropical Pacific region. We employ a multidisciplinary approach, utilizing regional coupled models, global climate models, and observational analysis techniques. The Postdoctoral Research Associate will have an appointment in the ATOC department at CU-Boulder. The individual will join a close collaborative project between the CU Boulder (Aneesh Subramanian, Kris Karnauskas), Colorado State University-Fort Collins (Charlotte DeMott), the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (Janet Sprintall, Rui Sun), the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory (Ho-Hsuan Wei) and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (Magdalena Balmaseda) investigating the key physical processes in the tropical West Pacific that govern the coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics during MJO and ENSO event evolutions.

We'd like to invite you to share this opportunity with potential candidates who might be interested. While skills in numerical modeling, data analysis, and the application of machine learning tools to geoscience problems are advantageous, they are not strict prerequisites for this position.

Thank you for helping us spread the word about this exciting research opportunity.
