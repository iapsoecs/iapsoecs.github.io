We are hiring an Associate Scientist (AS) at NCAR. This is a great
opportunity for someone technically adept with a bachelor's or master's
degree, including those eventually considering graduate school. Please
forward to any potentially suitable candidates.

The position is in the Oceanography Section of the Climate and Global
Dynamics Laboratory at NCAR and will focus on data-intensive approaches to
Earth system science. The successful candidate will make contributions to
open-source software frameworks supporting flexible, performant, scalable
analysis workflows, particularly those centered on the use of the Community
Earth System Model and engage in educational activities through Project
Pythia (projectpythia.org). The position is expected to contribute and
benefit from the growing Earth System Data Science community at NCAR and
beyond, including through involvement in on-going educational initiatives,
open source software projects, discussions on development activities, and
interfacing with the broader community, such as Pangeo (pangeo.io).
