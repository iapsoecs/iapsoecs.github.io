The University of Michigan seeks a postdoctoral scholar supervised by Prof. Yulin Pan (Department of
Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/fpel) and co-supervised by

Prof. Chris Ruf (Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering, http://www-
personal.umich.edu/~cruf/). The successful applicant will work on the understanding of flow physics

underlying the CYGNSS remote sensing detection of oceanic microplastics
(https://news.engin.umich.edu/2021/06/tracking-ocean-microplastics-from-space/) as well as the global
transport model of oceanic microplastics. Depending on the applicantâ€™s interest, specific topics can be
chosen from (1) Numerical and experimental study of the effect of surfactants and floating particles on
water waves and surface roughness; (2) Development of global or regional transport model for oceanic
microplastics and identification of the correlation between model results and CYGNSS measurements; (3)
Comparison of CYGNSS-measured mean square slope and its hindcast by ocean wave models to identify
and understand the reasons for their differences.
The successful applicant is expected to have a Ph.D. in fluid dynamics, oceanography or other related fields.
Expertise in computational fluid dynamics (especially multi-phase flow), ocean models and additional
knowledge of remote sensing are preferred. Interested applicant can directly contact Prof. Yulin Pan at
yulinpan@umich.edu with a CV and 1~3 representative publications.
This position is available immediately. The initial contract would be for two years, which can be extended
upon mutual agreement.
