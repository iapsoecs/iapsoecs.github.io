Research Associate - Antarctic/Southern Ocean Modelling

Full time, fixed term 3-year position based in Hobart. Contribute to modelling and understanding oceanographic processes in Antarctic and Southern Ocean waters.

 

The Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science (ACEAS) is a major $25M Special Research Initiative of the Australian Research Council.

 

The goal of ACEAS is to help the world community prepare for climate risks emerging from East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean by integrating knowledge of the ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere and ecosystems, and their interplay. ACEAS is a national-scale, University-led centre for excellence in Antarctic science focused on this goal.

 

ACEAS is led by the University of Tasmania with a range of Australian and International Partners (http://antarctic.org.au/).

 

**The Opportunity**

This role will contribute to ACEAS program 1 which addresses the overarching question: What processes are fundamental to the transport of heat, salt and nutrients between the Southern Ocean and Antarctic coastline? Specifically, the role will explore ocean dynamics in ACCESS-OM2 models and compare with observations.

 

Key Accountabilities:

    - Conduct complex numerical calculations of big data from high resolution ocean models and observations.
    - Design and implement innovative numerical experiments with high resolution ocean models to clarify key dynamical processes.
    - Contribute to the implementation of MOM6 in the next-generation ACCESS-OM3 models.
    - Co-supervise related research projects at the Honours and/or HDR level

**Your Application**

To be successful in the role, your application will need to demonstrate;

    - A PhD, or equivalent postdoctoral experience, in a relevant area (e.g. oceanography, climate science or similar).
    - A good record of, and continuing commitment to, research that has international recognition and made worthwhile contributions to the field of oceanography.
    - Expertise in ocean modelling, with high-level expertise in data analysis programming (e.g. Fortran, Python, Matlab).

 

**Remuneration**

Appointment at Academic Level A will have a total remuneration package of up to $110,239 comprising base salary within the range of $72,861 to $94,221 plus 17% superannuation.

 

Appointment at Academic Level B will have a total remuneration package of up to $136,519 comprising base salary within the range of $100,508 to $116,683 plus 17% superannuation.
