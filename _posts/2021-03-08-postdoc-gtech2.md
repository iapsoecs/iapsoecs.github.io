A postdoctoral position in climate science is available at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. The postdoctoral researcher will work closely with Dr. Susan Lozier on projects that aim to elucidate the atmospheric and oceanic processes that drive North Atlantic sea surface temperature variability on interannual, decadal and multidecadal time scales.

The initial term of the appointment will be 12 months, with the possibility of extension for another two years based on performance.

Job Responsibility:  The individual will be expected to conduct independent, high-quality research in climate science; publish papers; and present work at national and international conferences.  The researcher is also expected to work collaboratively with climate scientists at Georgia Tech and elsewhere on projects related to North Atlantic climate variability.

Qualifications: A PhD in atmospheric or oceanic science is required by the time of appointment. Strong quantitative and programming skills are expected and experience running?and/or analyzing output from?atmosphere or ocean general circulation models is desirable.  Excellent organizational and collaborative skills are required and strong oral and written communication skills are expected.

Start date: On or about June 1, 2021.

Salary: Commensurate with the individual?s experience and education.

To apply: Interested individuals should send a CV, a one-page statement of research interest, and the names and contact information of at least 3 references to Belal Elnaggar at belnaggar3@gatech.edu<mailto:belnaggar3@gatech.edu>.
