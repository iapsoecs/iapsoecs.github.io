The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) is a multidisciplinary center for climate and Earth system research located in Hamburg, Germany. It is one of the premier climate science research institutes in the world. Located in the heart of one of Europe’s most livable and vibrant cities, it provides a highly international and interdisciplinary environment to conduct scientific research as well as access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities. You can also have a virtual tour to our campus.

 
## THE POSITION

We are now opening a position for a
 
**Postdoctoral Scientist (W-0048 | all genders)**
 
The successful applicant will join a team of scientists working on the integration of an ice-sheet model into the next-generation, kilometer-scale Earth system model, ICON. The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is at the forefront of developing coupled, high-resolution simulations and provides the computational and research infrastructure needed to explore scientific questions that are beyond the reach of traditional modeling approaches.
 
In this project, the candidate will have the opportunity to advance our understanding of atmosphere–ocean–ice sheet interactions, which play a key role in present-day sea-level rise and high-latitude climate change. This will be achieved through the analysis of a novel coupled model configuration that includes interactive ice-sheet dynamics. The candidate will contribute to the ongoing development of this high-resolution coupled modeling system.
 
The research is part of TerraDT, a project within the European Commission’s Horizon Europe research infrastructure programme. TerraDT aims at improving the descriptions of Earth system components in the Destination Earth (DestinE) climate models.
 
## YOUR PROFILE
 
* PhD degree in oceanography, meteorology, physics, or another related field
* Experience in climate modelling, preferably with a focus on ocean dynamics
* Interest in high-latitude climate processes, and advancing understanding of these processes through numerical experimentation with physically based models
* Track record of excellent research as documented by scientific publications, presentations and personal references
* Excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work autonomously
