We are recruiting a PhD student to work with us in wonderful Gothenburg, Sweden.

This project brings together an ERC Synergy project (RECLESS) and a VOTO project (InTail). This studentship will quantify oxygen ventilation at high spatial and temporal resolution using a novel ultra-sensitive (0.1nM detection limit) oxygen sensor on underwater gliders and research cruises across multiple OMZs (Baltic, Costa Rica, ETNP).

The key aim is to map and understand these fine-scale intrusions in OMZ so that we can determine their biogeochemical impact. Important aspects are understanding transport and diffusion across these intrusions (relying on ADCP and microstructure turbulence in situ), as broader scale metrics to predict where these intrusions come from or will go (for example with FSLE from remote sensing and models).
