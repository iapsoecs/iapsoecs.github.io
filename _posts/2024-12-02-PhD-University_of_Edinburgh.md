Hi all,



I?m recruiting a PhD student to join my new Ocean Dynamics lab at the
University of Edinburgh. The position is funded through the NERC Edinburgh
Earth, Ecology and Environment Engagement Doctoral Training Partnership (E5
DTP). More details on this scheme, including eligibility and instructions
on how to apply, can be found at this link
<https://e4-dtp.ed.ac.uk/e5-dtp/application-process>.



The deadline for applications is *6 January 2025*. And the intended start
date for the position is September 2025.



As an E5 student, you will join the multidisciplinary Cryosphere Group
within Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences (https://edinburghcryosphere.org/),
which is composed of over 30 staff and students carrying out diverse
research across a range of cryosphere-related areas and regions of study.



The planned project
<https://e4-dtp.ed.ac.uk/e5-dtp/supervisor-led-projects/project?item=1678>
will use climate model output and observations to investigate variability
in ocean heat transport toward the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, there
is considerable flexibility within the broad topic of ice sheet-ocean
interactions, so please get in touch (cprend@uw.edu) if you?d like to
discuss!
