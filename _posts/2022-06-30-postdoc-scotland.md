We are looking for a talented and creative scientist to join the Marine Scotland Science Oceanography Group in Aberdeen, to conduct research on the environmental impact of large scale offshore wind development in shelf seas. This research will improve the evidence base underpinning our advice, and will be used to deliver technical advice to regulators and policy makers on the environmental impact of Marine Renewable Energy development.

 

For this role you will preferably have experience in coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical, bio-physical and/or ecosystem modelling, and be passionate about applying the best available science in policy and decision making. You will need excellent analytical and communication skills, and be able to work with a wide range of colleagues and stakeholders.

 

We will most likely be using our existing FVCOM models within our Scottish Shelf Model modelling suite.
