A post doc position is available within a new Center of Excellence, Center for Volatile Interactions (VOLT), at the Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen. The initial appointment is for 2 years with a possibility for extension, and the starting date is January 1st, 2024 or as soon as possible thereafter.

Scientific environment

The successful candidate becomes an integrated part of the Center for Volatile Interactions, led by Prof. Riikka Rinnan. We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in a dynamic, collaborative, and international research environment. The Center is housed in Universitetsparken, Copenhagen, where we have laboratory facilities and state-of-the-art instrumentation for analyses of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), molecular analyses of microbial community structure and activity, as well as incubation and climate chamber facilities. Marine Biological Section, located in Elsinore, provides state-of-the-art facilities for molecular and process-based studies of marine microorganisms. The center has currently two proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass-spectrometers (PTR-TOF-MS) used both for eddy covariance and chamber/headspace measurements of VOCs and two thermal desorber-gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers (GC-MS) including different sample introduction possibilities. The r
 esearch project is collaboration with Senior Scientist Christa Marandino from the Marine Biogeochemistry Research Division (Chemical Oceanography Research Unit) at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany.

Main tasks and responsibilities

The post doc will participate in a planned measurement campaign in the North Sea as part of the German Research Unit Biogeochemical processes and air-sea exchange in the sea surface microlayer (BASS), which investigates biogeochemistry, physics, and air-sea interactions within the sea surface microlayer. The candidate will be responsible for conducting eddy covariance measurements of biogenic trace gases as part of a larger team. The candidate is responsible for operation of a PTR-TOF-MS instrument as well as analyzing the resulting data. The post doc will also participate in climate chamber experiments focusing on VOC exchange in plankton cultures as well as related process studies under controlled conditions. The successful candidate will be responsible for lead-writing and co-authoring scientific publications. The candidate will also have the opportunity to supervise MSc students.

We look for a candidate with strong analytical skills, but many different skillsets and research backgrounds could fit to the position. More information and application link: https://employment.ku.dk/faculty/?show=159635
