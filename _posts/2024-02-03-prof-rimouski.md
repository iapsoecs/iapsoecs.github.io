The Institut des sciences de la mer (ISMER) of the Université du Québec à Rimouski (UQAR), one of Canada's leading academic marine science research institutes, is seeking a new professor of oceanography with a specialization in modelling. This tenure-track position is a research chair financed by the Transforming climate action program of the Canada First Research Excellence Fund (https://www.uqar.ca/tac-en). Research activities must align with the scientific strategy of the program, which aims to reduce uncertainties about the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and climate change.



The selected candidate must be specialized in climate dynamics, physical oceanography, modelling and observation of biogeochemical cycles, and/or in data assimilation. The areas of expertise sought are the ocean role in the climate system, as well as the influence of ocean dynamics and biogeochemical cycles on heat and carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and ocean. The selected candidate is expected to develop a unique and original research program, and collaborate with researchers at ISMER, other departments within UQAR, and the other universities of the Transforming climate action program. The selected candidate will participate in the MSc, PhD and DESS (Specialized Graduate Diploma) programs in oceanography through the supervision of graduate students and teaching. The working language is French.



At the time of hiring, the chosen person must have a doctorate in a relevant discipline (oceanography, physics, mathematics, atmospheric sciences, or related discipline) and a solid research record. At least one year of postdoctoral experience is expected.



Application documents must include a motivation letter including the description of a research and a training program for the next five years (max. 5 pages), a CV including research and student training achievements, and the name and contact details of three referees. Evaluation of applications will begin on April 15, 2024 and will continue until the position is filled.



All qualified applicants are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority. We subscribe to an equal access program and our community advocates the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion, and we put in place accommodation measures as needed. We strongly encourage women, people with disabilities, members of visible and ethnic minorities, Aboriginal peoples, and members of LGBTQ2S+ communities to apply. UQAR recognizes the effects that career interruptions can have on the assessment of the candidate's research achievements. If applicable, the candidates are invited to explain the situation in their application.
