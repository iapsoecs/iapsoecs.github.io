## Postdoctoral Fellowship in Ocean Observation, Analysis and Prediction

Vancouver or Victoria, British Columbia, Canada

Preferred Start Date: 1 September 2025 or earlier

 

Applications are invited for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of British Columbia or the University of Victoria to conduct glider-centred observational studies of ocean turbulence and its dynamical and/or ecological consequences in the NE Pacific Ocean and continental shelf of British Columbia, Canada. The successful candidate will join the team of the Canadian-Pacific Robotic Ocean Observing Facility (C-PROOF), a university, government, industry and not-for-profit collaboration that operates a fleet of autonomous gliders, floats, and moorings to provide ocean scientists with long-term monitoring of the ocean at the small scales important to understand upper ocean physical and biological processes. As part of Pacific Rim Ocean Data Mobilization and Technology (PRODIGY), the fellow will also contribute to the research, teaching, mentoring, and partner engagement initiatives of the PRODIGY training program, delivering advanced graduate and postgraduate training in ocean observation, prediction and knowledge mobilization.
