We have funding for an exciting 3yr PhD project on marine temperature
variability of the last millennia and robustness of the proxy record.
The position in part of the MARUM Cluster of Excellence
(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.marum.de/en/The-Ocean-Floor.html__;!!KGKeukY!kSSKBNCvBUMNKau2y1NtPlzq8nzQiSxxB-Kh87yUfQeghPgdwtog0xSpS5igm6GbM4U$ ) and the ERC SPACE
(Space-time structure of climate change).

The position encompasses lab work in organic geochemistry (Mass
spectrometry imaging), data analysis and statistics to better
understand how the past climate signal is recorded and can be best
retrieved from sediment cores.

The position will be situated at MARUM Bremen
(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.marum.de/en/about-us/HinrichsLab-Home.html__;!!KGKeukY!kSSKBNCvBUMNKau2y1NtPlzq8nzQiSxxB-Kh87yUfQeghPgdwtog0xSpS5igFdEkZvI$ ) with the
option to move to AWI Potsdam
(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.awi.de/en/science/geosciences/polar-terrestrial-environmental-systems/research-foci/earth-system-diagnostics.html__;!!KGKeukY!kSSKBNCvBUMNKau2y1NtPlzq8nzQiSxxB-Kh87yUfQeghPgdwtog0xSpS5igK59lNzM$ )
during the second half of the PhD.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know of any
appropriate candidates (ideally interested in organic chemistry,
climate research and statistics), and/ or forward this email to anyone
you feel is relevant. I apologize if you receive this announcement
more than once.
