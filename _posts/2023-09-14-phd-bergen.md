Two PhD positions in physical oceanography/climate dynamics related to the overturning circulation in the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean are open at the University of Bergen, Norway. Both positions are for a fixed-term period of 3 years with the possibility of a 4th year with compulsory other work (e.g., teaching duties at the department). The positions are also associated with the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research.

PhD1: https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/249820/phd-research-fellow-in-physical-oceanography

PhD2: https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/249988/phd-position-in-climate-dynamics

PhD1 will focus on the conditions conducive for water mass transformation in or near the East Greenland Current, identify when and where these are met, and place the present state of water mass transformation in the East Greenland Current into historical and future contexts. This will be achieved primarily through analysis of available and new observations, including moored and shipboard measurements of velocity and hydrography as well as hydrographic profiles from autonomous gliders and floats.

PhD2 will investigate the mechanisms of overturning variability in the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean, and especially the relationship between overturning circulation and surface forcing. The project will also assess how present and future overturning changes in the Nordic Seas are manifested in the subpolar North Atlantic (OSNAP). The PhD project will rely on the analysis of available observations and data from ocean models/reanalyses.

Deadline is 17 October.
