We have an open PhD position in Physical Oceanography at IOW, Germany.
The PhD position is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) for the research project 'Watermass transformation and small-scale mixing processes in the Skagerrak' (SkaMixWMT).

This position is a part of the international SkaMix Consortium (Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and The Netherlands) to study watermass transformation in the Skagerrak, linking the North Sea and Baltic Sea. The PhD project focuses on the numerical modelling of the watermass transformation processes using Eulerian and Lagrangian methods to understand how watermasses enter, mix, and form new outflows.

Questions can be directed to Hans Burchard and Manita Chouksey. Application deadline is 27th June, 2025.

Application details are in the attachment and on the website:
