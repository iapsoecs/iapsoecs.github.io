I am excited to announce that the Georgia Tech Ice & Climate group has a
two-year postdoctoral fellowship available as a part of the Stochastic
Ice Sheet Project, funded by the Heising-Simons Foundation. This project
is led by Alex Robel at Georgia Tech, and is in collaboration with
Andrew Thompson at Caltech and Helene Seroussi at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, CA. The project scope includes: (1) the
development of StISSM, a stochastically parameterized ice sheet model in
which small-scale processes are simulated by stochastic processes, and
(2) large ensemble simulation of the past and future evolution of the
Greenland Ice Sheet with StISSM for attribution and uncertainty
quantification studies. Within the project scope, the postdoctoral
fellow's responsibilities are flexible and depend on their interests and
experience. The position is based in Atlanta, GA (USA), with
opportunities to spend time working with collaborators at Caltech/JPL.
Flexible and remote work arrangements are negotiable. Application
information is below, and more detailed information about the position
can be found at this link:

Application eligibility and details: Candidates will be considered who
have a PhD (or anticipated completion of a PhD by September 2021) in any
relevant science or engineering field. Interested candidates may apply
by e-mailing application materials to Alex Robel (robel@eas.gatech.edu
<mailto:robel@eas.gatech.edu>), in the form of a single PDF with: (1)
CV, (2) contact information for three references that can speak to the
candidate's qualifications for this position, and (3) a short statement
(less than 300 words) explaining their interest in this position and
relevant previous experience/research. Review of applications will begin
October 31, 2020.
