CMCC Position, 
Junior Scientist or Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Marine Biogeochemical Modelling

Deadline: May, 15th, 2022

The CMCC is taking into consideration the possibility to hire a talented, motivated and proactive Junior Scientist/Postdoctoral Research Assistant to work within the Research Unit for Marine Biogeochemistry and Earth System Modelling of the Ocean Modeling and Data Assimilation (ODA) Division.

This job announcement is a public invitation to express interest for the above mentioned CMCC Position.

The location is at the CMCC premises in Bologna, BO, Italy.

The primary purpose of this position is to strengthen our in-house modelling system based on the the Biogeochemical Flux Model (http://bfm-community.eu) and its couplings to dynamic ocean models such as NEMO and SHYFEM and our Earth System Model CMCC-ESM2. Some of the current key developments include coastal processes, polar biogeochemical processes including sea-ice biogeochemistry and parametrisation of marine-based negative emission pathways (nature-based and technology based). The candidate is further expected to contribute to the applications of our modelling system and analysis of its simulations in the realms of global biogeochemical cycles, mitigation and adaptation as well as biodiversity and ecosystem services. These activities require a solid base in geoscientific modelling, in-depth knowledge of the scientific state of the art and of the most recent developments in data analysis and statistical methods (e.g. machine learning and artificial intelligence).

The desired qualifications are:

- PhD in natural sciences with experience in the fields of oceanography, marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems;
- High standard of scientific outputs, as proven by your scientific track record (considering a career level in line with the position offered);
- Consolidated experience in scientific programming and data analysis, demonstrated skills in FORTRAN and/or python programming as well as parallel computing is of particular advantage;
- Proficient skills of spoken and written English;
- Collaborative skills in a highly competitive environment.

Belonging to legally protected categories (ex L. 68/99) will constitute a preferential condition.
