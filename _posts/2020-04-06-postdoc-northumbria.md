At Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, we have two open Research Fellow positions in ice-sheet and ice-ocean modelling

These positions are fixed term positions and funded through external research grants.

The successful candidates will have a PhD in either physics or mathematics, or in a related discipline such as glaciology, oceanography or geophysics. Experience in numerical modelling of either ice-flow or ocean circulation is desirable.

Both positions are expected to commence on 1st June 2020, and the application deadline is 3 April 2020. Salary range is from £35,844 - £40,322.

One of these positions is for 4 years and is funded as a part of a part of a large EU funded H2020 project (TiPACCs) involving several European research institutes. The overall aim of TiPACCs is to assess the likelihood of large and abrupt near-future changes in the contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to global sea level, caused by tipping points in the Antarctic continental shelf seas and the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The post involves the use of coupled ice-ocean models. More information about this EU project TiPACCS can be found athttps://www.tipaccs.eu/

Another 3-year position is a part of the PROPHET project within the UK/US joint International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. The project PROPHET (PROcesses, drivers, Prediction: modeling the History and Evolution of Thwaites) aims at improving model projections of Thwaites Glacier to reduce the uncertainty in the projection of the glacier’s behaviour and subsequent contribution to sea-level rise in the future. The post involves constructing, implementing and testing new approaches to the description of calving and the evolution of ice damage.

This PROPHET project is led by Hilmar Gudmundsson (Northumbria Univ.), Mathieu Morlighem (UCI) and Daniel Goldberg (Univ. of Edinburgh), in collaboration with Indrani Das (Columbia), Brent Minchew (MIT) and Noel Gourmelen (Univ. of Edinburgh).

Northumbria has an active research group focusing on Extreme Environments (https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/research/changing-challenging-world/extreme-environments/), and a large number of full-time staff members working on research topics related to the cryosphere (https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/geography-and-environmental-sciences/our-staff/).  For more information about the Department and its research, please visit our homepage at: https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/geography-and-environmental-sciences/.

The University of Northumbria at Newcastle (UNN) is the 6th biggest University in the UK. Currently, Northumbria University has 38,000 students from 135 countries and 3,000 staff and located in the central part of Newcastle upon Tyne. The University has branches at partner institutions in Asia and Europe. The University compromises four academic Faculties including the Faculty of Engineering and Environment (EE) and the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences (HLS). In the latest UK Research Excellence Framework (2014) – a national research assessment exercise based on peer review of publications, impacts and awards data – research was judged to be “internationally excellent” or “world leading” in all disciplinary areas in which UNN submitted.
