**Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the area of Physical Oceanography**
for the research topic
**Upwelling and temperature variability in the Northeastern Tropical Atlantic**


The 3-year position is located in the Physical Oceanography group at the Institute of Environmental Physics (IUP) at the University of Bremen. The Postdoctoral researcher will conduct independent research on the topic of “Upwelling and temperature variability in the Northeastern Tropical Atlantic” and publish the results in scientific peer-reviewed journals. Scientific questions to be addressed include the relation between sea surface temperature and upwelling variability as well as the investigation of additional processes contributing to near surface temperature variations off Mauritania. These processes are to be investigated based on a variety of data sets such as direct observations and reanalysis products and may include the collection of additional new data.


Application deadline is June 24, 2025
