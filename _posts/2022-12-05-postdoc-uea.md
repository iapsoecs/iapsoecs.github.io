PDRA position at the University of East Anglia in the area of climate modelling, available from 1 June 2023, for a fixed term period of up to 24 months.


The University of East Anglia wishes to recruit a Senior Research Associate to undertake research into better understanding past and future climate change in the Pacific Ocean through climate modelling, as part of the NERC-funded project “Pacific Rainfall On Millennial Scales” (PROMS), which is a joint project with the University of Southampton.

 

The South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) is the largest perennial rainfall feature in the Southern Hemisphere, plays a significant role in global climate, and dominates climate dynamics over the tropical South Pacific Ocean. Despite this, surprisingly little is known about how this feature varies on multi-decadal to millennial timescales. Quantitative reconstructions of past SPCZ rainfall show that the SPCZ has undergone rapid, but as yet poorly understood, changes over the past 3500 years which are larger than those changes observed during the past few decades, and not apparently correlated with any global climate forcing. This suggests that large-scale, multidecadal modes of variability, and their associated sea surface temperature anomalies, play an important role in forcing SPCZ variability.


The role of the PROMS SRA at UEA will be to run and analyse a set of targeted climate modelling experiments, which are specifically designed to investigate the role of large-scale multi-decadal modes of climate variability on the SPCZ. Together with novel observations and proxies collected by other members of the PROMS team, the research will lead to better understanding of the variation of the SPCZ on multidecadal to centennial timescales, with implications for better quantification of uncertainties in SPCZ evolution during this century.

 

The applicant will be working with Profs Manoj Joshi, Adrian Matthews and Tim Osborn in the School of Environmental Sciences and the Climatic Research Unit.
