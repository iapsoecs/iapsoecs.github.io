We are advertising a Co-tutelle position in Antarctic climatology to start in October 2024 as part of the Australia-France Network of Doctoral Excellence (AUFRANDE, https://aufrande.eu/ ). AUFRANDE is a unique PhD training program co-funded by the European Union bringing together 37 research centres in France and Australia. It provides a unique opportunity for students to be enrolled in doctoral programs at two entities in France and Australia, and successful candidates will be awarded dual doctorates.

 

The research topic covered by our PhD position (DC-5) is related to detecting and understanding extremes in climate variability in Antarctica: Climate extremes in Antarctica.

 

Three potential topics are offered, giving the successful applicant the freedom to choose a topic most aligned to their research interests and background:

 

Option 1: INVESTIGATION OF ATMOSPHERIC RIVER SIGNALS IN EAST ANTARCTIC COASTAL ICE CORES.

Option 2: ROLE OF INDIAN OCEAN TROPICAL/EXTRATROPICAL VARIABILITY IN THE GENERATION OF EXTREME EVENTS IMPACTING THE EAST ANTARCTIC COASTAL REGIONS

Option 3: ANALYSIS OF LOCAL TO SYNOPTIC WEATHER CONDITIONS DURING DRY TO EXTREMELY DRY EVENTS IMPACTING THE SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS OF EAST ANTARCTIC FIRN IN THE FRENCH AND AUSTRALIAN SECTORS

 

The successful candidate will be based at the Institute of Environmental Geosciences (joint research unit of CNRS, Grenoble Alpes University, INRAE, Grenoble INP and IRD, FR) for ~ 2 years and will spend one year in Australia where they will be hosted at the University of Tasmania.
