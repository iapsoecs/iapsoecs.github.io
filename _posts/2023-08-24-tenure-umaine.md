The University of Maine's School of Marine Sciences (SMS) seeks to fill a full-time, academic-year, tenure-track position of Assistant Professor of Oceanography to begin as early as January 1, 2024.  We seek a physical oceanographer who complements the oceanographic, coastal, and climate expertise in SMS and other units at UMaine (including but not limited to Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth and Climate Sciences).

We invite applicants from all fields of physical oceanography.  We particularly seek candidates who have an interest in working across disciplines (within and outside marine sciences).

Applications are encouraged from candidates with interest in topics important to state priorities and needs, which include understanding and adapting to environmental change, and marine resource management.  Geographic regions of interest include, but are not limited to, the northwest Atlantic, the Gulf of Maine, and high latitudes.  Applications are also encouraged from those whose research plans will take advantage of and build upon the infrastructure available as part of the University of Maine?s Ocean Observing program (http://gyre.umeoce.maine.edu/buoyhome.php).

Review of applications will begin October 16, 2023
