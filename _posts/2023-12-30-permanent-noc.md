The UK National Oceanography Centre has a permanent research position that is now open for applications.  

The successful candidate will join a world-leading research team focusing on the development and analysis of observation-based datasets describing the changing climate of the ocean. 

This is a research-focused role using marine observations to improve our understanding of air-sea interaction. A key part of the work is an improvement to our understanding of uncertainty in air-sea fluxes.
