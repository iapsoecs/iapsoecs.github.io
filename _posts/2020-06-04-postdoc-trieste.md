*The ECHO Group at the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied
Geophysics  – OGS (Trieste, Italy; https://www.inogs.it/en
<https://www.inogs.it/en>) offers four positions in the field of “Modeling
of marine ecosystems”.*
POSITION: Post Doc (Italian “assegno di ricerca junior”), Full Time

DURATION: 12 months (+ renewal up to 6 years maximum)

SALARY: EUR 25.000 (EUR 27.000 at the third year renewal)

ABOUT THE ROLE:
Research activity consists of development, application and analysis of
models for the study of the marine ecosystems. Successful candidates will
work in a multidisciplinary team within the international projects FAIRSEA
(Fisheries in the AdrIatic Region - a Shared Ecosystem Approach), CMEMS
(Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service for the Mediterranean
Sea), FORCOAST (Earth Observation Services for Fishery, Bivalves
Mariculture and Oysterground Restoration along European Coasts), VENEZIA
2021 (Programma di ricerca scientifica per una laguna regolata), ICCC
(Impact of Climate Change on the biogeochemistry of Contaminants in the
Mediterranean sea).

*The research activities include 4 open positions:*

*- Position 1: physical-biogeochemical modeling of climate scenarios in the
Mediterranean Sea.*

*- Position 2: ecosystem model of the Adriatic-Ionian region for scenario
analysis of fisheries management practices.*

*- Position 3: Physical ocean modelling, with focus on the Mediterranean
Sea, its marginal seas and coastal areas.*


*- Position 4: Biogeochemical modelling of marine ecosystem, with focus on
the Mediterranean Sea, its marginal seas and coastal areas.*
HOW TO APPLY:
See website https://www.inogs.it/en/node/1683 and carefully follow all the
instructions.
New deadline:  10 June 2020

ABOUT YOU:
We are looking for a young scientist able to understand concepts quickly,
following a sharp learning curve, with good planning skills and the ability
to work independently. You will have enthusiasm, the willingness to exploit
your skills in ocean sciences research for the benefits of communities
pursuing sustainable growth, and be seeking the opportunity to develop your
research career through scientific publications. You will be able to
actively participate in the R&D activities of collaborative research
projects, both at a national and international level, and have a desire to
become a future leader in your field.
We expect that your skills and qualifications will include:
- as minimum education requirement, a University Degree (MSc or equivalent)
in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines:
Physics, Mathematics, Environmental Sciences, Engineering, Chemistry,
Biology, Computer Sciences;
- some experience in computational sciences or statistics, with knowledge
and proved use of scientific programming languages or advanced software
environments (e.g. Fortran, C, Python, Matlab, R);
- a PhD (or equivalent experience) in Ocean Sciences, Ocean Modelling,
Ecosystem Modelling or any topic involving modelling or data analysis
approaches to research activities covered by the call will be considered
advantageous.

ABOUT US:
ECHO is the marine modelling research group of OGS and focuses on
quantitative approaches to biogeochemistry and ecosystem dynamics. ECHO’s
research activity includes the development, analysis and use of models of
varying complexity (physical models, biogeochemical models, food webs,
ecological models) with applications at a variety of scales, ranging from
local high-resolution applications to basin-wide regional model and
climatic projections. Applications include assessment of natural and
anthropogenic pressures on marine systems, carbon and nutrient cycling,
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, ecosystem approach to fisheries and
aquaculture, operational oceanography and data assimilation, analysis of
integrated eco-socio-economic systems, and sustainable development. The
ECHO group is currently composed of about 30 people, who are collaborating
widely with other groups in Italy and at the international level in various
research projects, services, programmes and networks. ECHO offers a lively
research environment and excellent infrastructure in terms of laboratories
and state-of-the-art equipment.
