The Center for Data Science (CDS) and the Courant Institute at New York University (NYU) invite an application for a joint Faculty Fellow position ( https://cds.nyu.edu/fellowsjobs/ ) to lead scientific machine learning research as part of a new multi-institution international project, M2LInES ( https://m2lines.github.io/ ). The scientific goal of this project is to integrate machine learning advances into climate modeling in order to improve climate projections. The successful candidate will jointly hold a highly prestigious CDS Faculty Fellow (https://cds.nyu.edu/dsfellows/) position.

The successful candidate will have the opportunity to lead research at the growing interface between Machine Learning and Climate Science, and can take advantage of the unique intellectual opportunities afforded by NYU. They will integrate the MÂ²LInES NYU team, currently composed of Profs Joan Bruna, Carlos Fernandez-Granda and Laure Zanna, as well as three postdoctoral researchers, and will have experience in working with researchers across different fields.

This is a full-time, non-tenure position, with a light teaching load of one CDS course per year as the primary instructor, and participation in service activities. This appointment, available September 2022, will be for one year with the possibility of renewal.
