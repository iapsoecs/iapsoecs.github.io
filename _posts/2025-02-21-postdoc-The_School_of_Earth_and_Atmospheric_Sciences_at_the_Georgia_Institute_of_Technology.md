The School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia invites applications for a postdoctoral fellow position in Paleoceanography and Ocean Modelling.

 

The postdoctoral researcher will be working with Jean Lynch-Stieglitz (Georgia Tech) and Jake Gebbie (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) supporting an NSF-funded project that will use geochemical measurements from surface and sub-surface dwelling planktonic and a state-of-the-art community-supported ocean model to provide a better understanding of the ocean-atmosphere system in the Tropical Indo-Pacific during the Last Glacial Maximum. 

 

Responsibilities may include: 

* Compiling and analyzing geochemical proxy data.
* Performing experiments and analyzing output of a state-of-the-art ocean model.
* Using inverse methods to combine information from the proxy data and model.
* Writing scientific journal articles based on research results.

 

A doctorate in Paleoceanography, Physical Oceanography, or any related field is required by the start of the appointment. Experience with ocean modelling and/or paleoceanographic proxy reconstruction is preferred.

 

Please contact Jean Lynch-Stieglitz (jean@eas.gatech.edu) or Jake Gebbie (jgebbie@whoi.edu) if you have any questions about the position. 

 

Applications need to be submitted through the following website by March 20th, 2025: https://tinyurl.com/35hytdnw
