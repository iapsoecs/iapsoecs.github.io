Junior Professorship (W 1) in Marine Meteorology
Deadline: 15th May 2025

Kiel University and GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel aim to attract more qualified women to professorships.

The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at Kiel University, Germany, and GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel jointly invite applications for a

Junior Professorship (W 1) in Marine Meteorology

with temporary civil service status for an initial period of four years (first phase) to start at the earliest possible time.

The Professorship is located at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel (www.geomar.de) in the research unit “Maritime Meteorology” which is part of the research division “Ocean Circulation and Climate Dynamics”.

The Junior Professor is expected to initiate and lead excellent and internationally recognized research in the field of meteorology with links to ocean and climate research. We are looking for a candidate with research experience and interests in one or more of the following areas:

* Observations and remote sensing
* Theory, modelling and diagnostic of ocean-atmosphere interactions
* Understanding the processes of atmospheric dynamics and physics in the troposphere and stratosphere
* Analysing atmospheric climate fluctuations, including extreme weather events
* Development of atmospheric components of Earth system models
* Data science and machine learning for the evaluation of meteorological data or as a basis for digital twins
* Sea-going research

The Junior Professor shall thematically and methodically enhance the existing capacity of the research unit, expressed by a research plan. We particularly expect interdisciplinary cooperation within the research division and across disciplines within Kiel Marine Sciences (KMS). The professorship is associated with teaching in the Kiel Bachelor's/Master's degree programs (within the teaching obligation) in English and potentially also in German in the field of meteorology and climate physics, for which a suitable teaching concept must be submitted.

The successful applicant should have a university degree in mathematics, natural sciences or engineering and a PhD in meteorology, physical oceanography, climate sciences, physics, mathematics or data science in Earth system sciences and a publication record in meteorology ordata science in Earth system sciences and a publication record in meteorology or climate sciences. Experience in obtaining third party funding and teaching is an advantage.

Please refer to the recruitment requirements of § 64 of the Higher Education Act of the State of Schleswig-Holstein. After successful evaluation of the first phase of the junior professorship it is the aim to extend the temporary civil servant status for another period of two years (second phase). More information can be found at www.berufungen.uni-kiel.de (in German).

For additional information about the position and the research unit please contact Prof. Dr. Arne Biastoch (abiastoch(at)geomar.de).
