The Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science (EOAS) at the Florida State University (FSU) invites applications for an open-rank tenure-track professor position in Physical Oceanography. This is an endowed professorship to support an expert in the field of Physical Oceanography whose research and teaching are exemplary. The William K. Dewar Endowed Professorship will provide supplemental funding to support their research and/or teaching, as well as operational and programmatic expenses. The ideal candidate should have a solid background in addressing fundamental research questions about the functioning of the ocean and have characteristics that encompass original thinking, unconventional ideas, brilliance, innovative, novel, interdisciplinary approaches, and deep theoretical insights. Applications from those skilled in observational analyses, measurements, modeling, theory and/or interdisciplinary investigations will be particularly welcomed.

Appointees are expected to develop and maintain a vigorous externally funded research program in their specialty area of interest and to teach courses and contribute to both the undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the department. Candidates must hold a Doctoral degree or the highest degree appropriate in Geosciences or a related field.

EOAS is housed in a recent building (2020) with state-of-the-art facilities and laboratories, has approximately 40 academic faculty members and 135 graduate students, and offers undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in Geology, Meteorology, Oceanography, and Environmental Sciences. FSU also hosts a local High Performance Computing Center. Aside from the faculty within EOAS, the successful candidate can expect collaborations with the Center for Ocean-Atmosphere Prediction Studies, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute, the Coastal and Marine Lab, and the departments of Mathematics and Scientific Computing.
