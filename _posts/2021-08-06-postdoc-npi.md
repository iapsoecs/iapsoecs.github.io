A fixed-term researcher (post doctoral) position as part of the EU H2020 funded CRiceS project is open for applications. Applications are due 31st Aug.


You will investigate ocean-ice/snow-atmosphere dynamical interplay in the Arctic and Southern Oceans. The primary aims are to deepen our understanding of the dynamical processes and provide recommendations for climate model improvements.


For this purpose, you will analyse large sets of available in situ observations of ocean, sea ice and snow on sea ice variables in combination with atmospheric reanalyses, satellite products and CMIP6 climate model results. A working hypothesis is that polar ocean stratification and its interplay with the sea ice cover is important to represent well in models in order to  simulate the state and development of the polar oceans.
