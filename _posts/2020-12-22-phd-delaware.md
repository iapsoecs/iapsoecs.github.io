Funded graduate student opportunities (Masters and PhD) are available at the University of Delaware. One project is focused on the dynamics of transport and transformation of freshwater on Antarctic Continental shelves using both modeling and observations. A second is focused on the study of the physical drivers of ecosystem change along the Antarctic Peninsula as part of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program (<https://pal.lternet.edu>).

Both projects include opportunities for fieldwork in Antarctica.

To learn more about these opportunities, please visit:

For full consideration, applications to the Physical Ocean Science & Engineering at University of Delaware should be submitted by January 5th, but late applications will be evaluated.
