NYU Courant's Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science is seeking an outstanding researcher with strong physical insight to join the research group of Prof. Laure Zanna (http://laurezanna.github.io <http://laurezanna.github.io/>).

The position will focus on quantifying and understanding drivers of coastal sea-level change along the Eastern US. The work will involve: 1) quantifying changes in sea level and associated extremes along the US East and Gulf Coasts; 2) understanding the key drivers and mechanisms of open-ocean and coastal sea level (e.g., anthropogenic forcing, atmospheric storms, ocean circulation). The work, which is data-driven, will rely on dynamical and statistical analyses from a suite of state-of-the-art coupled climate simulations developed at GFDL/Princeton. The candidate will be expected to build strong links with collaborators at Princeton/GFDL (Drs. Stephen Griffies, Ming Zhao) and the University of Arizona (Dr. Jianjun Yin).

The position is available immediately (with some flexibility about the start date). Appointments will be initially for one year, renewable conditional on satisfactory performance and funding (for up to 3 years).

The project is funded by NOAA Climate Variability & Predictability (https://cpo.noaa.gov/Funding-Opportunities/FY2020-Recipients/CVP-Decadal-Climate-Variability-and-Predictability).
