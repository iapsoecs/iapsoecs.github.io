**Postdoctoral position in global biogeochemical cycles.**

The School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, seeks a postdoctoral Research Associate to participate in research on the ocean’s biological pump and how it responds to climate change. The core of this ARC-funded project is to develop observationally constrained models of the ocean’s carbon, nutrient, and oxygen cycles, and to embed these models into global ocean circulations of different climate states to assess the effects of environmental change on the biological pump. The Research Associate will work with Mark Holzer (UNSW) in collaboration with Nathan Bindoff (U Tasmania), Richard Matear (CSIRO), and Francois Primeau (UC Irvine), providing excellent opportunities for national and international collaboration.
