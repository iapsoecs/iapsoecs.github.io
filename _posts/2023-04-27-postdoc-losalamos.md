Come join the brightest minds at the most innovative R&D facility supporting National Security! The Computational Physics and Methods Group (CCS-2) at Los Alamos National Laboratory is seeking a climate modeling and analysis postdoc to investigate processes and feedbacks associated with Arctic Amplification.

There is nothing ordinary about the work being done at LANL, and CCS-2 is no exception. Our ~55 staff, postdocs and students conduct fundamental scientific research and develop computational methods and algorithms across a broad range of physics areas in order to answer questions relevant to LANL’s national security mission. The HiLAT (High-Latitude Application and Testing of Earth System Models) team is applying cutting edge modeling tools to understand the drivers of Arctic Amplification, ranging from Machine-Learning Assisted Reduced-Order Models to the Department of Energy’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM).

The successful applicant will work as part of the HiLAT team, in a multidisciplinary and collaborative environment that includes project partners at other National Laboratories and at universities. In collaboration with their future mentor, the successful applicant will develop and execute a research plan related broadly to the role of the ocean and sea ice in Arctic warming. This plan will allow them to develop new skills and knowledge, and to produce results that will be published in the scientific literature and presented at scientific conferences.

CCS division has a staffing focus area around Diversity, Inclusion, Belonging and Equity. Individuals from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

Minimum Job Requirements:
Technical Expertise: Expertise in some or all of the following areas:

    High-latitude climate science
    Large-scale physical oceanography
    Numerical climate modeling
    Reduced-order climate modeling
    Climate model analysis
    Climate feedback analysis

Communication: Demonstrated effective interpersonal skills, as well as excellent oral and written communications skills. Demonstrated ability to publish in the relevant academic journals.

Problem Solving: Demonstrated ability to analyze and provide creative solutions for technically complex problems.

Programming: Experience with programming languages such as Python and Fortran for scientific applications.

Education/Experience: Ph.D. in physical oceanography, climate science, or similar field.

Desired Qualifications:
Interest to work in an interdisciplinary team of scientists.

Work Location:
The work location for this position is onsite and located in Los Alamos, NM. All work locations are at the discretion of management.

Notes to Applicants:
