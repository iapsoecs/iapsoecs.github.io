We have recently acquired NOAA funding for a post-doctoral researcher
position who will be focused on the role of the Pacific and Atlantic
Oceans in modulating ENSO and ultimately how this relates to southern
U.S. drought. The position will incorporate both climate modeling and
statistical/machine learning skills, so these skill sets are highly
desirable. More details about the position are available here:
