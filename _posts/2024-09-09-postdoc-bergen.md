The position is associated with the Horizon Europe projects TipESM (https://www.tipesm.eu) and OceanICU (https://ocean-icu.eu). TipESM will explore tipping points, their driving processes, and their impacts using the latest generation of Earth System Models. Within the TipESM project, the successful applicant will analyse physical and biogeochemical tipping points in the global ocean, their downstream effects on carbon uptake, oxygen content, and nutrient availability, and their impacts on marine ecosystems. OceanICU will further increase our knowledge on the role of the ocean in the global carbon cycle, focusing in particular on the functioning of the biological carbon pump, with the aim to develop practical management tools. Within the OceanICU project, the candidate will conduct a meta study to assess the ocean carbon pumps in the context of glacial-interglacial change and how the role of biology has changed with time, and thereby providing a baseline for modelling studies of how changes in the ocean carbon sequestration mechanisms altered atmospheric CO2.
The candidate will be part of the Biogeochemistry Research Group at the Geophysical Institute, of the Carbon System Research Theme at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research. The candidate is also expected to actively engage in research collaboration across both TipESM and OceanICU, and to be motivated to perform research at an internationally competitive level.
TipESM and OceanICU are funded by the European Union, Horizon Europe Funding Programme for research and innovation under GA Nr.101137673 and GA Nr 101083922.
