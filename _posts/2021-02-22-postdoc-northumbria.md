We are currently looking to fill two Ocean/Ice modelling posts within the Department of Geography and Environmental Sciences at Northumbria University (Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK).  Details are as follows:

**1) Postdoctoral Researcher - Ocean/Ice Modeller**

Faculty of Engineering and Environment

 Fixed Term For 36 Months, Full Time, ?35,844 - ?40,322

 Closing Date: 28/02/2021

 Ref: EAE/20/3368

 
 Applications are invited for a three-year postdoctoral research position in ocean/ice modelling, funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 programme.  The post will contribute to two EU projects: PROTECT (2 yrs of funding) and TiPACCs (Tipping Points in Antarctic Climate Components, 1 yr of funding).  The work will focus on improving the representation of ocean circulation beneath ice shelves in large-scale, primitive equation ocean models.  The candidate will primarily work with Adrian Jenkins, Hilmar Gudmundsson and Chris Bull at Northumbria University.  The successful candidate will have a PhD in either physics or mathematics, or in a related, numerate discipline such as glaciology or geophysics.  Experience in numerical modelling and background in or knowledge of applied mathematics is desirable.  The post will commence in early to mid-2021.

 **2) Postdoctoral Researcher - Ocean/Ice Modeller**

 Faculty of Engineering and Environment

 Fixed Term For 48 Months, Full Time, ?35,844 - ?40,322

 Closing Date: 28/02/2021

 Ref: EAE/20/3363



 Applications are invited for a four-year postdoctoral research position in ocean/ice modelling, funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).  The project will focus on developing our understanding of the role played by the oceans in driving ice sheet change.  Specific regions of interest are East Antarctica and northern Greenland, but there will also be a general/theoretical focus on the role of ice shelf topography, in particular the basal channels that characterise many of the ice shelves, on the sub-ice ocean circulation and the resulting ice shelf melt rates.  The candidate will primarily work with Adrian Jenkins, Hilmar Gudmundsson and Jan De Rydt at Northumbria University, as well as with Helen Johnson in the Department of Earth Sciences at Oxford University.  The successful candidate will have a PhD in either physics or mathematics, or in a related, numerate discipline such as glaciology or geophysics.  Experience in numerical modelling and background in or
 knowledge of applied mathematics is desirable.  The post will commence in early to mid-2021.
