title: Four PhD positions in attribution of extreme events (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium)

We are seeking four talented PhD candidates to join us in the effort to
better constrain the probabilities of occurrence of past and future extreme
events and to arrive at robust attribution statements that do not
understate nor overstate the future risks society will face.

The different positions are centered around different types of climate
events (floods over Europe, heatwaves and compound drought-heat events over
Europe, and sea ice extent reduction in the Antarctic), each leading to
distinct methodological challenges.

The PhD grants are financed through the Action de Recherche Concertée (ARC)
called “EXALT - EXtreme weather Attribution at mid- and high-Latitudes
using advanced statistical Techniques”, under the supervision of Profs.
Francesco Ragone, François Massonnet and Johan Segers from UCLouvain and
Anna Kiriliouk from UNamur.
