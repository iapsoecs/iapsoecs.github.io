We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to investigate the mechanisms that control the influx of Atlantic Water and its subsequent journey through the Arctic Ocean. A main goal is to deepen our understanding of Atlantic Water features at the marine-terminating glaciers on the North Greenland margin, and how this may vary with a changing climate. 

We seek candidates with a strong background in physical oceanography, climate modelling (paleo or other), geoscience, physics or applied mathematics with an interest Artic physical oceanography. Proven experience in climate modelling, especially ocean modelling, is highly desirable.  An interest in big-picture climate questions across time scales is an advantage and experience with the EC-Earth model would be an additional merit. Likewise, it is meriting to have documented experience in using High Performance Computing infrastructure. 

This postdoctoral position is part of a large project funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, called THAWING, which explores the critical role that changes in the properties and pathways of Atlantic Water reaching North Greenland play in the near-term stability as well as the long-term evolution of the North Greenland Ice Sheet, its marine cryosphere and sea-ice ecosystems. As such, the project involves collaboration with other postdoctoral scientists, PhD students, and faculty within the Department of Geological Sciences and other scientists in the Bolin Centre for Climate Research at Stockholm University. This initiative provides a unique opportunity for you to engage with a broad multi-disciplinary network and apply a variety of analysis methods to state of the art ocean and climate models to contribute to our understanding of the vulnerability of the Arctic ocean. 

The deadline is 15 May 2025 and the application requires submission of a CV, short research plan, publications, and contact details of 2-3 references. For details and how to apply, please see the application web link.

Informal inquiries about the posts are welcome and should be directed to Agatha de Boer (agatha.deboer@geo.su.se).
