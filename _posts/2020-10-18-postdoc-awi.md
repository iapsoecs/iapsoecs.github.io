The Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) seeks motivated candidates for a postdoc position on Climate Modelling and Isotope Research.

**Project**

This position is part of the CiASOM project ("Changes of water isotopes
in Arctic Sea ice, Ocean and atMosphere"). In this project, novel
isotope data sets obtained during the MOSAiC expedition will be studied
to better understand the Arctic water cycle and its future changes. The
aim of the CiASOM project is to investigate the different Arctic
moisture sources and their contribution to the global water cycle and to
quantitatively record relevant exchange processes between ocean, sea ice
and atmosphere. To this end, stable water isotopes will be used as
climate and environmental parameters for the study of the current water
cycle and isotope measurements will be linked to high-resolution climate
simulations.

**Tasks**

- A series of high-resolution climate simulations will be carried out
using the atmosphere model ECHAM6, which includes explicit isotope
diagnostics. These climate simulations will be used to link isotope
measurements carried out on-board FS Polarstern and various Arctic land
stations and to enable a common interpretation.
- For the intended model-data comparison, it is necessary to
systematically process and analyse the water vapour isotope data
measured with a CRDS instrument on FS Polarstern. In addition, it is
planned to compile, standardise and prepare further isotope data sets
from various Arctic land stations for comparison with the climate
simulations carried out, in cooperation with international partners.

**Key requirements**

- PhD in the field of physics, meteorology, geo-sciences, climate
sciences, or similar
- Experience with complex climate models (application and evaluation)
- Experience in measurement and interpretation of stable water isotopes
would be an advantage

**Details of position**

- Start of position: November 1st 2020 or as soon as possible
- full-time position
- place of employment: Bremerhaven, Germany
- contract duration: 3 years

**Deadline for applications**

October 21st 2020
