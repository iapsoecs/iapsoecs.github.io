We are seeking a Postdoc Investigator to investigate processes along upwelling ocean margins, which play an important role in the global carbon cycle. The postdoc will participate in the Ocean Margins Initiative, an Ocean Biogeochemical Virtual Institute funded by Schmidt Sciences. The project will examine how physical forcing, coastal upwelling, and cross-shore transport at multiple scales impacts phytoplankton productivity, biogeochemistry, and the fate and transport of organic carbon from an upwelling ocean Margin. The postdoc will be an integral part of an observational effort in the Gulf of Guinea and will be involved in data analysis and process modeling. Scientific interaction with a multidisciplinary group of PIs and international students will offer the opportunity for developing a multi-year research collaboration with scope for outreach and community building in Ghana. 

Expertise in data analysis, modeling, observational work and integration of physical and biogeochemical measurements is a plus.
