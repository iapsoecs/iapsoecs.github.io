We are looking for a biogeochemical modeller to join our team at Cefas. If you are interested and/or would like further information, please feel free to get in touch.

Job Title: Senior Biogeochemical Modeller
Deadline: 21st December 2021

The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science is the UKâ€™s leading and most diverse centre for applied marine and freshwater science. We currently rank in the top 5% of over 2,500 international institutes publishing in the same fields. We advise government and private sector customers in the UK and abroad on the environmental impact of their policies, programmes and activities through our scientific evidence and impartial expert advice.

This role provides an exciting opportunity to work across multi-disciplinary projects, collaborating with oceanographers, biogeochemists, marine ecologists, and fisheries scientists, delivering quantitative applied marine science for a range of UK and international customers. The successful applicant for this post will be involved in a range of biogeochemical modelling activities relevant to ocean and coastal processes. For example, linking catchments to coastal water quality, effects of eutrophication, seabed carbon sequestration, and the potential for Blue Carbon management.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and adaptable individual, with a strong background in biogeochemical modelling. You will work with a wide network of scientists, from universities and research institutes, both nationally and internationally. You will enjoy liaising with colleagues from a diverse range of marine disciplines, expanding your knowledge of broader marine science applications, and contributing towards proposals and new ideas.
