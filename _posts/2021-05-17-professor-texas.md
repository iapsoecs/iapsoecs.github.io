*Tenure-track Assistant Professor Position in the Department of
Oceanography, College of Geosciences, Texas A&M University*

The Department of Oceanography at Texas A&M University is seeking
applications for a full-time tenure-track faculty position with a 9-month
academic appointment at the rank of Assistant Professor. The successful
candidate should apply observational, experimental, theoretical,
