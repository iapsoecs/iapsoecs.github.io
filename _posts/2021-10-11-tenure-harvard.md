**Tenure-Track Professor in Cryosphere Studies, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Harvard University**

The Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences (EPS) invites applications for an open faculty position in any area of cryosphere studies, including the development and application of observational platforms, field-based research, theory, and computational modeling. We are particularly interested in candidates whose work advances our understanding of climate change. This is a tenure-track appointment at the assistant level. We seek to attract an individual who will establish an innovative research program and teach both undergraduate and graduate students. We are especially interested in individuals whose work spans or complements the intellectual interests of Harvard faculty, including—although not limited to—the general areas of modern and paleo climate, and the fields of atmospheric and ocean sciences, hydrology, sea level change, geochemistry, geology and planetary sciences. There is also the opportunity to work with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  

A doctorate or terminal degree in a field of science related to cryosphere studies is required by the expected start date, currently July 1, 2022.  We also seek candidates who have a strong commitment to teaching. We value diversity in our faculty and are committed to building a culturally diverse intellectual community.  We especially welcome applications from members of historically underrepresented groups and candidates with experience teaching and working with diverse communities and students.

Please submit applications online at: https://academicpositions.harvard.edu/postings/10681 
Required materials include a cover letter, curriculum vita; a statement of research and teaching interests; a statement describing efforts to encourage diversity, inclusion, and belonging, including past, current, and anticipated future contributions in these areas; four representative publications; and the names, institutional affiliations, and e-mail addresses of three references. Review of applications will begin November 8, 2021 and conclude when the position is filled.
