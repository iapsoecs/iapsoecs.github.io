The Fluid Dynamics and Solid Mechanics group (T-3) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is seeking qualified applicants in the areas of Earth system model simulation and analysis with a specific focus in the area of Southern Ocean climate processes. Candidates with experience in modeling and analyzing coupled ocean, ice, and atmospheric processes in the Southern Ocean, or Antarctic ocean-and-ice-shelf interactions are especially encouraged to apply. The successful candidate will contribute heavily to the development and application of the DOEâ€™s new earth system model, E3SM, which is focused on addressing science questions related to DOE missions. Within E3SM, LANL oversees the ocean, sea ice, and land ice model components and contributes expertise on high-latitude climate processes, including coupled interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, sea ice, and land ice. Of particular interest for this position is an understanding for how coupled Southern Ocean climate processes influence current and future rates of Antarctic sub-ice shelf melting and linkages to global climate processes. The candidate will be expected to perform outstanding research in the field of Southern Ocean climate across a wide range of scales within the context of Earth system modeling. This position will be filled at the postdoc and/or Scientist 2 or 3 level, depending on the skills of the selected candidate. Additional job responsibilities will be assigned if the candidate is hired at the level of a Scientist 2/3.
