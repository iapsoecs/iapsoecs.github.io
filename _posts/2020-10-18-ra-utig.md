The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (https://www.ig.utexas.edu) (UTIG) seeks to hire three Research Staff members in the following broadly defined areas: (1) Coastal Processes and Geohazards; (2) Solid Earth-Cryosphere Interactions; and (3) Crustal Deformation, Earth Surface Change, and Geodesy. We seek colleagues who creatively use theoretical, computational, observational and/or experimental approaches to address fundamental problems in understanding processes on Earth or other planets. Current areas of research at UTIG include, but are not limited to: ice sheet and ocean dynamics, marine geology and geophysics, plate tectonics, earthquake seismology, planetary geophysics and habitability, climate dynamics, and paleoclimatology. We are interested in candidates who will bring new research expertise and perspectives to UTIG, and who have the potential to build bridges between existing areas of research strength. Successful applicants will be expected to contribute to a dynamic and diverse research community at the University of Texas at Austin through the development of a vigorous, internationally-recognized, and externally-funded research program, and through engagement with colleagues, postdoctoral scholars, and students. Candidates must hold a Ph.D., or be near completion of this degree in Earth Science or a related field. We particularly welcome applications from candidates from nontraditional research backgrounds and from scientists who understand the experiences of those underrepresented in higher education and research.

We anticipate hiring at the Research Associate rank. Research Associates are part of the research staff at UTIG and receive six months of institutional salary support, with the rest obtained from externally-funded research programs. Research appointments at UTIG follow a career track similar to that of academic faculty, in which the rank of Research Associate is approximately analogous to that of Assistant Professor. Research staff at UTIG can advise or co-advise postdocs, and both graduate and undergraduate students.

UTIG is part of the Jackson School of Geosciences, which houses top research programs across all areas of the Earth Sciences. UTIG is also closely allied with the Texas Advanced Computing Center (https://www.tacc.utexas.edu), and it is involved in several research centers and programs at UT focused on emerging Earth Science problems, such as the Center for Planetary Systems Habitability (https://habitability.utexas.edu), the Center for Space Research (https://www.csr.utexas.edu), and the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (https://www.oden.utexas.edu). UTIG employs both computational- and field-based technical support staff, and operates a variety of field equipment and lab facilities (https://ig.utexas.edu/facilities).

Applications should include a cover letter, curriculum vitae, a two-page statement of research interests, a one-page diversity statement, up to three recent peer-reviewed publications, and the names and contact information of three qualified persons who can provide the search committee a reference letter upon request. For full consideration, applications should be submitted by December 1, 2020. You can view and apply for the positon on the University's job page (https://utaustin.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/UTstaff/job/PICKLE-RESEARCH-CAMPUS/Research-Associate_R_00010367).  For any further questions, please contact the search committee chair: Harm Van Avendonk (e-mail: harm@ig.utexas.edu).
