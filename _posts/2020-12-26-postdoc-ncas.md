Research Scientist

Job reference: SRF34279

Location: University of Reading, UK

Closing date: 07/01/2021

Job live date: 08/12/2020

Salary: ?30,942 - ?40,322 per annum

Employment type: AR-Research

Department: School of Mathematical Physical & Computational Sciences

Division: National Centre for Atmospheric Science, Department of Meteorology

Hours per week: 1.00 FTE

Employment Basis/Type: Fixed term for 30 months

We seek a talented post-doctoral scientist to carry out research to better
understand the representation of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean
circulation in coupled climate models and its sensitivity to model
resolution. This research is an important component of a recently funded
UKRI-NERC research project, SNAP-DRAGON, and is a collaboration between the
National Centre for Atmospheric Science and several other research centres
in the U.K. and U.S.

To understand the sensitivity of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean
circulation to resolution you will analyse and evaluate a suite of
state-of-the-art coupled model simulations performed by the U.K. Met Office
with varying atmospheric and oceanic resolutions. Furthermore, by using
diagnostic tools you will understand the sensitivity of both the mean-state
and variability of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean circulation to the
representation of atmospheric and oceanic processes.

You will have:
*       A PhD or equivalent in mathematical or physical science, or should expect to shortly receive one
*       Strong scientific analytical ability, creativity, and self-motivation
*       Experience of analysing output from ocean or climate models, or similar datasets
*       Good communication skills and the disposition to collaborate effectively with both internal and external project members
