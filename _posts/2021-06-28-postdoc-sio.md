Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UCSD invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher to investigate continental shelf/slope dynamics around Antarctica and Greenland in a global mesoscale ocean/sea-ice model, in which freshwater representing land-ice melt is released. Potential research directions could include cross-shelf property exchanges and their governing dynamics, the role of slope fronts as barriers to exchange, the impact of property exchanges between adjacent deep basins, and metrics to assess model performance. The successful candidate will work with Dr. Julie McClean and Prof. Sarah Gille and will be expected to conduct independent research, publish papers and present results at scientific meetings.

Candidates must have received a Ph.D. in physical oceanography or a closely related field such as atmospheric or climate science, and have strong quantitative, modeling and statistical skills. Advanced knowledge of computer languages such as Python, Matlab and Fortran is also necessary. Experience working with climate model codes such as the Community Earth System Model in high performance computing environments is highly desirable. Excellent communication skills and an ability to work collaboratively are also required. 

Initial appointment is for one year with the possibility of extension.

Salary is commensurate with qualifications and experience and is based on UC salary scales.

Applicants are asked to submit a curriculum vitae, a statement of research experience and interests, and names of at least three references to Dr. Julie McClean (jmcclean@ucsd.edu).  Review of applications is immediate and will continue until the position is filled.

The University of California, San Diego is an AA/EOE.
