A postdoctoral position is available with Andrew Stewart in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, in collaboration with Aviv Solodoch at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Andy Hogg at the Australian National University, and Georgy Manucharyan at the University of Washington. The postdoctoral researcher will work on a NASA-funded project to develop Machine Learning approaches to detect variability in the global ocean Overturning Circulation. The research will involve working with CMIP6-class and high-resolution global ocean model output, NASA ocean reanalysis products, and NASA satellite products. A strong background in physical oceanography is required, and experience with machine learning methods is strongly preferred. The position is available immediately and is initially for two full years. To apply, please send a CV and the names of three references to Andrew Stewart directly via astewart@atmos.ucla.edu.
