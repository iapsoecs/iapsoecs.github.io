Job Description Summary:

UCAR is excited to announce the job opening for the CPAESS Postdoctoral Researcher role working with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). This postdoctoral researcher will investigate the relationship between the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and extreme sea level (ESL) events along the U.S. East Coast, with a focus on understanding the reversibility of changes in the ESL events and predicting the mean sea level/statistical characteristic of ESL events on multiyear to decadal time scales. The outcome of this project will be useful for the improvements of our understanding and predicting sea level on multiyear to decadal timescales.

What You Will Do

Here is a brief summary of what one would expect to be generally responsible for in this role.

Processing and analysis of observational datasets and climate model outputs:

Identify patterns and modes of AMOC variability on decadal to multidecadal time scales in the preindustrial control simulation and quantify their modulation effects on the mean dynamical sea level and statistical characteristics of ESL events along the U.S. East Coast.

Investigate the reversibility of changes in ESL events as we decrease greenhouse gas emissions and other drivers. Revisit the AMOC changes in future climate and identify their roles in the mean sea level and statistical characteristics of ESL events responses.

Investigate the potential multiyear to decadal predictability (or prediction skill) of mean sea level and statistical characteristics of ESL events using both diagnostic methods and prognostic decadal hindcasts/forecasts initialized from observations.

Investigate the impacts of model resolution on the ESL events responses. Identify potential roles of major hurricane/storm activities (high atmosphere resolution model) in the ESL events responses. Identify potential mechanisms and processes of cross-shelf break connections (high ocean resolution model) between coastal sea level and AMOC.

Examine ESL case studies that may compound mean sea level changes, extreme weather events, local heat content, and SST changes in high-resolution models.

Community and Stakeholder Engagement:

Provide expertise to the scientific and stakeholder communities by attending virtual and/or in-person research workshops and conferences.

Give presentations at conferences, seminars, and/or webinars.

Review scientific manuscripts, and write scientific journal articles.
