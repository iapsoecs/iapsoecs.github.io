Two postdoc positions are available at the Department of Ocean Science, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (https://oces.hkust.edu.hk/).


1). A postdoc position in lateral tracer stirring/mixing

The postdoc researcher will work on a project to characterize the lateral tracer exchange/mixing between the coastal and open ocean environments, with an emphasis on the role of mesoscale turbulent stirring across continental margins. The research involves working with high-resolution ocean models and utilizing both Eulerian/Lagrangian techniques to track suspensions and physical/biogeochemical properties.

2). A postdoc position in flow/topography interactions

The postdoc researcher will work on a project to characterize the flow/topography interactions over continental slopes and ridges. Attention will be paid to the multi-scale interactions and energy pathways through the bottom boundary layer processes and interior oceanic motions. The research involves working with high-resolution numerical simulations and in situ mooring datasets.

Both positions are initially contracted for one full year. An extension up to three years in duration is anticipated, subject to satisfactory progress with the projects. To apply, please send a CV (with full publication list) and names of at least two referees to Dr. Yan Wang via yanwang@ust.hk. Applications will be accepted until the positions are filled. A PhD in Physical Oceanography, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, or a related discipline is required. Prior experience in scientific computing is desirable but not demanded. The applicants are encouraged to get in contact for more information.
