Two fully funded PhD positions are available at Uppsala University, Sweden. 



The turbulent fluxes across the air-sea-ice interface in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), i.e., the transitional area between open water and pack ice, are crucial for polar weather, ecosystem, and climate on both local and global scales. The presence of sea ice floes, varying from centimeters to hundreds of kilometers in size, creates an exceptionally heterogeneous surface characterized by varying roughness and temperature profiles. These characteristics significantly affect the momentum and heat fluxes across the air-sea-ice interface, and other processes. Despite this significance, our understanding of the turbulent fluxes across the interface in the MIZ remains fragmented and poorly represented in prevailing weather and climate models. The primary objective of the two projects is to explore the turbulent fluxes across the air-sea-ice interface in the MIZ and to elucidate its implications for polar extreme cyclones on both short and long-term scales.
