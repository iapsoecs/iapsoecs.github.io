The US Naval Research Laboratory Ocean Sciences Division is seeking
applicants for a postdoc opportunity in physical oceanography and ocean
acoustic prediction beginning in 2021.

Project Description:
The focus of this project is to develop and apply a predictive
artificial intelligence (AI) model that provides extended range ocean
forecasts. Postdocs working on this project will have the ability to
focus on a number of areas:
(1) Developing an AI prediction system that utilizes deep learning.
(2) Applying novel AI interpretation and visualization techniques to
geophysical data.
(3) Investigating the local and remote impacts of physical modes of
ocean variability relevant to various forecast horizons of the ocean
environment.
