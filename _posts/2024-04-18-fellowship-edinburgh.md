The School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh is pleased to
invite applications for two 2024 Patience Cowie Fellowships. The
Fellowships are fixed term for 36 months and covers a lot of subject areas,
including climate research.

We welcome applications from all qualified candidates, and wish to
particularly encourage applications from under-represented backgrounds in
their research area, e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, disadvantaged
circumstances, etc. The candidate should have completed a PhD in the fields
and disciplines represented by the institutes in our School, or in another
relevant field, and should be able to demonstrate the potential for
independent research and a future academic career. It is open until early
may.
