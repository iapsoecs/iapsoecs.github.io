VISITING RESEARCH SCIENTISTS

ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES

PRINCETON UNIVERSITY/GFDL

In collaboration with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University solicits applications to its Visiting Research Scientist Program funded by the Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES).
The AOS Program and GFDL offer a stimulating and supportive environment with significant computational and intellectual resources in which to conduct collaborative or independent research. Independent researchers and more senior scientists who wish to visit GFDL for the purpose of collaboration, for sabbatical or short visits, will be considered for partial support.  We seek applications in all areas of earth system science within the three research themes of CIMES: 1) Earth System Modeling; 2) Seamless prediction across time and space scales; 3) Earth System Science: Analysis and Applications.
Further information about the Program may be obtained from: http://aos.princeton.edu/. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact potential hosts at GFDL and Princeton University prior to application to discuss areas of possible research.
Complete applications, including a CV, copies of recent publications, three letters of recommendation, and a research proposal of approximately 5 pages including the project title, should be submitted by April 17th, 2021 for full consideration. A goal of our department is diversifying the community of scientists and making the field more equitable and inclusive. With this in mind, we will take into consideration personal experiences as well as efforts in education, outreach or other service activities related to earth system science, which may be described in a separate section of the research statement. Applicants must apply online to https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/19581. Advanced degree is required. We would like to broaden participation in earth system scientific research and therefore encourage applications from groups historically under-represented in science.
Princeton University is an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
