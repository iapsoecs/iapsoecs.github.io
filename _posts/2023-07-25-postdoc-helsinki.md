As part of a new Academy of Finland project “Combining Coupled Modelling and Machine Learning to Constrain Antarctica's Uncertain Future”, we are announcing a postdoctoral research scientist position at the Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR), University of Helsinki. The project is a collaboration between the Arctic Centre of the University of Lapland and INAR. The consortium leader is Professor John Moore.

Our ICEMAP consortium will bring physically based modelling and Machine Learning (ML) together through Gaussian Process Emulation and Regression to more thoroughly explore factors influencing uncertain projections of Antarctica’s contribution to sea level than has been previously possible. The postdoctoral research scientist position involves ocean modelling in the Framework for Ice Sheet - Ocean Coupling (FISOC) with models such as ROMS and FVCOM and working on the use of emulation in building projections of land ice contributions to sea level rise. The postdoctoral researcher will assist in answering the following research questions: What is Antarctica’s projected contribution to sea level rise by 2300, including quantification of uncertainty? What are the main environmental contributors to uncertainty in Antarctica’s projected contribution to sea level rise by 2300? How effectively can ice shelf basal melt be parameterised without implementing an ocean model?

Experience in programming (e.g., Fortran, Python), computer simulations and data analysis is essential. The candidate should have a PhD preferably in physical oceanography or equivalent experience. The full-time post is available from 1 September 2023 (later start dates may also be considered for the right candidate) and is for a fixed term of period of up to 4 years.

Closing date: August 14, 2023
