Applications are invited for the post of Researcher in Physical Oceanography to undertake research on multidisciplinary oceanographic processes on the Antarctic continental shelf in the Ross Sea, Antarctica.  You will work with Professor Karen Heywood on the NERC- and NSF- funded project Predators to Plankton: Biophysical Controls in Antarctic Polynyas. Our focus will be on the physical oceanographic processes underpinning the ecology from krill to penguins.

You will participate in the design and delivery of the field campaign using ocean gliders. You will analyse the resulting observations and collaborate with the US scientists in the project to compare these with current understanding and/or numerical model output.  You will lead publication of the results in international peer reviewed journals.

The research will be based within the Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (COAS) at UEA, Norwich, UK. You will join the interdisciplinary UEA Ocean Glider group (www.ueaglider.uea.ac.uk) that includes faculty, postdoctoral researchers and PhD students using ocean gliders to evaluate processes in the global oceans.

You should have (or be soon to gain) a PhD in physical oceanography and a publication record showing evidence of international quality. You should have excellent oral and written communication skills, with experience of presenting results at conferences either in person or online.

This post is available to start between 1st September 2022 and 1st January 2023 on a fixed-term period for 18 months. The post can be full-time or part-time.

Closing Date: Monday 9th May 2022
