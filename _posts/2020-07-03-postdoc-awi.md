In the framework of EU Project "PROjecTing sEa-level rise: from iCe sheets to local implicaTions (PROTECT)", we investigate the future contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to global sea-level rise. We pursue the implementation of a coupled ice sheet - ice shelf - ocean model based on our Finite Element Sea-ice Ocean Model (FESOM) and the ice flow model. To join an international team, AWI section "Physical Oceanography of the Polar Seas" opens a position for an experienced ice/ocean modeller (m/f/d).


**Tasks:** 
- coupling of an existing global FESOM configuration to the ice flow model
- model-based analysis of the governing processes
- projections for the Antarctic contribution to future sea-level rise


**Requirements:**
- PhD in physical oceanography, physics, or a related field
- excellent knowledge of the physical oceanography of the Southern Ocean, including ice shelf-ocean interaction
- good knowledge of Antarctic Ice Sheet glaciology
- experience in implementation and analysis of numerical models


We offer a 24-month position starting from 1st September 2020.
