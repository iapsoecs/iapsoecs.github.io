For the project Atlantic Ocean Circulation over the Past Two Millennia and its Impact on European Climate (AMOC-Millennia) PIK is seeking a
Postdoctoral researcher AMOC (m/f/d)
(Position number: 04-2025 Postdoc Amoc)
in the field of Earth System modelling, starting on 01/05/25.


The position is funded for 3 years. Remuneration is in accordance with the German public tariff scheme (TV-L Brandenburg), salary group E 13. This is a full-time position with a weekly working time of 40 hours. The position can be filled on a part-time basis.


## Background

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a critical element of the Earthâ€™s climate system. Understanding its behavior in the past is important for how it will change in the future and for the impacts this will have on European climate. This project aims to shed light on AMOC variability and change during the last two millennia by combining climate model simulations with proxy data, using particle filter data assimilation, and to link this to climate variations over Europe.


## Key responsibilities:

* Implement online data-assimilation for the POEM Earth System Model
* Perform climate simulation ensembles of the past two millennia with assimilated paleo-proxy data to identify forced vs. natural AMOC variability
* Investigate the impacts of AMOC changes on European climate using these simulations
* Work closely with partner colleagues at UCLouvain to identify key periods for simulations with the higher resolution EC-Earth model


## Requirements:

We require a PhD in a relevant subject area such as climate physics, paleoclimate, oceanography, mathematics, or related field and experience working with climate models and their output. Ideally, you would have experience with data assimilation techniques and have a solid background in programming languages such as Fortran, Python, Bash etc.


## We expect:

* The ability to work independently and on your own initiative
* A methodical and systematic approach
* Structured and goal-oriented thinking
* Capacity to familiarise yourself quickly with new topics
* Creativity and openness to new approaches
* A high level of competence in oral and written English
* Reliability, engagement, and a high level of motivation
* Capacity for teamwork

## We offer:

* The chance to be part of an engaged, interdisciplinary team
* A stimulating working environment in an internationally recognised research institute on Potsdam's beautiful, historic Telegrafenberg campus, a short commuting distance from Berlin
* Flexi-time and mobile working (up to 50% of your hours)
* A collective pay scheme and associated benefits as well as a subsidized travel card or Deutschland-Ticket Job.
