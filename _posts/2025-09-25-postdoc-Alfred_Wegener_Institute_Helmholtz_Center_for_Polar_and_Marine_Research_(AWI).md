 In the framework of my Emmy-Noether group Artemics (Arctic internal wave energetics and mixing and their interdependence with sea ice in changing climate conditions) Iâ€™m looking for a postdoc to investigate Arctic internal tides, their interplay with sea ice, and the resultant internal tide generation. The overarching goal is to understand the underlying dependencies and to develop the forcing for a consistent internal wave mixing parameterization for the Arctic. The approach is leaning heavily towards numerical modeling, but involves linear theory as well as a comparison of the parameterization against observations. 


It is a full-time position for 2.5 years but suitable for part-time employment. The application deadline is October 5th.
