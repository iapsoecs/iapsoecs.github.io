We're recruiting for a researcher to work with us on the modelling the global
impact of ice sheets and climate change tipping points at the University
of Reading, UK.

The UK Earth System Model has the most sophisticated two-way coupled
representations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets amongst the
CMIP climate models so this is an exciting opportunity to work on ice
sheet science within the UKESM team and be at the forefront of this
rapidly developing area of science.

This is a 3.5 year fixed-term post funded by Horizon Europe/UKRI projects TipESM and
OptimESM. The closing date for applications is 31/07/2024
