We are pleased to re-advertise a postdoctoral researcher (R2) job opportunity at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center to work on high-resolution climate modelling.

We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented researcher to investigate the role of mesoscale ocean eddies on the North Atlantic Ocean circulation variability and its future changes, using simulations with global coupled model configurations at ground-breaking eddy-resolving scales (grid size of ~10 km). The researcher will be hosted by the Climate Prediction Group at BSCâ€™s Earth Sciences Department, and will work closely with Dr. Eduardo Moreno-Chamarro and Dr. Pablo Ortega. 

Deadline for applications is the 15th of October. 

Further details are provided in the published offer at the BSC site: https://www.bsc.es/join-us/job-opportunities/33921escpr2 

For informal inquiries about the position, please contact us at eduardo.moreno@bsc.es and/or pablo.ortega@bsc.es. 

We look forward to your applications.
