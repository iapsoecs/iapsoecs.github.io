The Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (JIMAR) is
currently recruiting an Analyst to work with NOAA’s CoastWatch/OceanWatch
Program (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw/index.html) who will be based at
the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center’s Ecosystem Sciences Division
in Honolulu, HI.  The Analyst will manage the OceanWatch satellite remote
sensing datasets and will also have the opportunity to conduct original
research for the creation of new and value-added oceanographic and climate
products derived from satellite remotely sensed data and from
atmosphere-ocean general circulation models.  Developing, managing, and
conducting OceanWatch outreach and education activities is also an
important aspect of the position.

Primary qualifications include a Master’s Degree from an accredited college
or university in Oceanography, Marine Biology, Climate Science, or
Mathematics and three to five (3-5) years of professional experience
working with satellite remotely sensed oceanographic data or climate
products to quantitatively derive information about biological physical or
oceanographic phenomena.  Desired (secondary) qualifications include a PhD
from an accredited college or university in the fields noted above and
knowledge of NOAA programs in remote sensing applied to oceanography,
particularly the OceanWatch program.

DEADLINE: Please note the deadline to apply is October 8, 2020.
