**Postdoctoral researcher in regional modeling of polar ocean, sea-ice, and snow sources of atmospheric aerosols**

Polar regional modeling focus. Applications are invited for a 24-month postdoctoral position (1 year contract with possibility of 1 year extension) starting between January 2022 and June 2022 as part of the CRiceS<https://www.crices-h2020.eu> (Climate Relevant interactions and feedbacks: the key role of sea ice and Snow in the polar and global climate system) H2020 project based at IGE (Institut des Geosciences de l'Environnement, https://www.ige-grenoble.fr) in Grenoble, France. Research will focus on improving model descriptions of ocean, sea-ice, and snow sources of atmospheric aerosols in the polar regions. This work will be conducted in close collaboration with polar observers within and outside the CRiceS project to provide insight into the sources of polar aerosols and for using observations to evaluate model developments. In collaboration with the team, the aim is to deliver improved representation of polar aerosols and to work in collaboration to quantify their influence on polar clouds.
