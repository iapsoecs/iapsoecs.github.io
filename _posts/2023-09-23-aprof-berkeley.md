The Department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of
California, Berkeley invites applications for an Assistant Professor
Faculty position with an expected start date of July 1, 2024. We seek
candidates from all areas of earth and planetary science, with an emphasis
on, but not limited to: (1) climate dynamics and climate history (including
paleooceanography, paleoclimate, study of the cryosphere and physical
oceanography); (2) solid earth geophysics; and (3) mineral, energy, and
water resources. Candidates whose research falls into one of these broad
areas or their disciplinary interfaces are especially encouraged to apply.
All candidates, regardless of the field in earth and planetary science,
will be considered.

The Department is dedicated to advancing equity and accessibility for all
who are, or wish to be, members of our community. The Department is
committed to addressing the family needs of faculty, including dual career
couples and single parents. We are also interested in candidates who have
had non-traditional career paths or who have taken time off for family
reasons (e.g., caring for children, the disabled, or the elderly), or who
have achieved excellence in careers outside academia (e.g., in professional
or industry service). For information about potential relocation to
