The University of Washington Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and
Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) is searching for a postdoctoral scholar to lead
a research project analyzing global ocean biogeochemistry data from
observation-based products and numerical models to advance understanding of
ocean variability and change in support of NOAA's Climate Ecosystems
Fisheries Initiative. The position will be based at the NOAA Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and will be mentored by and/or collaborate
with scientists from CICOES, NOAA PMEL, and NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory (GFDL). The postdoctoral scholar will evaluate the model and
observation-based data sets (e.g., temperature, salinity, oxygen, nitrate,
and carbon variables) in terms of their mean state, variability, and trends
as well as changes in the extent and overlap of ecosystem stressors. The
project will focus particularly on NOAA GFDL's Modular Ocean Model (MOM6)
coupled with the Carbon, Ocean Biogeochemistry and Lower Trophics (COBALT)
model, which is being used for baseline regional hindcasts as part of
NOAA's Climate, Ecosystems, and Fisheries Initiative (CEFI). The aim of
this project is to identify discrepancies between observation-based and
model data sets to reveal gaps in process-level understanding of ocean
biogeochemical interactions that will inform the targeted deployment of
observational assets to address these gaps.
