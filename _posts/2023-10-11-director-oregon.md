A successful OIMB Director will bring an ambitious and compelling vision for the role of the marine field station through the next century of biology scholarship and education, matched with a world-leading and productive research program that has outstanding potential for external funding and graduate training. The ideal candidate?s research will capture both public and academic attention and leverage the rich faunal, floristic, or environmental resources to which the OIMB, with the Director's stewardship, provides access. The next Director must also embody a commitment to both graduate and undergraduate education and curricular innovation that emphasizes real-world field and research experience. An additional requirement is that the Director fosters diversity, equity, and inclusion at every level from public outreach through education to faculty development and mentorship. The appointee will lead an academic program for OIMB that takes full advantage of local and regional marine habitats and organisms, and will be strongly involved in programmatic development and funding efforts on behalf of OIMB, including support for undergraduate and graduate recruitment and teaching and shaping the anticipated expansion of the coastal campus beyond the traditional boundaries of marine biology. The Director will also take on the role of liaison to the Biology Department, the College of Arts and Sciences, and other units on the main campus in Eugene, as well as the local coastal community.

Department or Program Summary

OIMB is located on the mouth of Coos Bay, in Charleston, Oregon, a 2.5 hour drive from the main UO campus in Eugene. OIMB is embedded within a diverse array of marine and estuarine habitats, ranging from the highest-energy rocky shores and the open ocean to the calmest of salt marshes or a busy marina hosting productive fisheries. Eastern Pacific Ocean biodiversity is rich, exciting, and full of opportunities for fundamental discovery or applied science. The Institute is an optimal site for research and teaching, with a resident faculty, graduate program, and a well-developed, popular, and rigorous undergraduate major in Marine Biology. The field station includes modern research laboratories, a brand-new research vessel, library, laboratory classrooms and auditorium, dining hall, dormitories, and accommodations for visiting scientists (http://oimb.uoregon.edu). The campus includes the Charleston Marine Life Center (a well-attended cross between museum, aquarium, and outreach center) and shares space collaboratively with neighboring South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.

We start looking at applications on Nov. 20, 2023 (ad: https://careers.uoregon.edu/en-us/job/532148/director-oregon-institute-of-marine-biology).
