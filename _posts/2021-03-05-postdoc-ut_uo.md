Postdoctoral Fellowships: Greenland Ice Sheet Ocean Science (GRISO) Network 
Topic: Oceanography / Glaciology / Ice-ocean Interactions / International Collaboration
Available Positions: 2
Duration: up to 3 years


Description: GRISO (GReenland Ice Sheet Ocean network, <https://griso.ucsd.edu/>) is a five-year NSF-funded AccelNet project that aims to advance research by facilitating interaction across disciplines, methodologies and existing networks. GRISO aims to explore the interaction of ice, ocean, atmosphere, marine ecosystems and communities along Greenland's coastal margins. GRISO builds on a decade of community initiatives (<https://griso.ucsd.edu/publications/>) and will grow its efforts via summer schools, training in scientific collaboration, seminar series, international exchanges, and focused workshops. Working groups will tackle questions relevant to: 1) Ocean forcing Greenland, 2) Greenland forcing ocean, 3) Impacts of a changing coastal Greenland on ecosystems and communities, and 4) Progress on a Greenland Ice-Ocean Observing System (GrIOOS).


We are seeking two postdoctoral researchers to take leadership roles in GRISO, helping to facilitate working group activities, tackle scientific questions based on their backgrounds, and connect the different communities exploring ice-ocean processes along Greenland?s coastal margins. As a postdoc with GRISO, you will work closely with the entire GRISO PI team in a collaborative fashion. One postdoc will be formally based with An Nguyen at the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and the other will be with Dave Sutherland at the University of Oregon (UO). Both postdocs will have the flexibility and support to develop scientific questions related to the working group activities, as well as follow distinct research avenues with their respective advisors. At UT, research will have a strong emphasis on Northern high latitude ocean-sea ice modeling and data assimilation, whereas at UO, the research emphasis will be more geared toward coupled ice-ocean interaction processes. At either institution, the postdocs will have the opportunity to participate in collaborative project training, organizing and co-leading summer schools for graduate students, and communicating GRISO results at national and international conferences.


Advisors & Location:
An Nguyen, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, <https://crios-ut.github.io>
Dave Sutherland, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, <https://oceanice.org/>

Qualifications. We seek postdoctoral researchers with a background in oceanography, glaciology, climate science, hydrology, or other fields that are relevant to ice-ocean interactions along the Greenland coastal margin. Successful applicants must demonstrate clear experience with, or a commitment to, cross- disciplinary work, which could include participation in cross-disciplinary teams, managing multi-person research projects, and/or building integrated research networks. Applicants should have a record of good written and spoken communication skills, as well as evidence of being an independent researcher with a collaborative attitude. Successful applicants must have a Ph.D. by the start date. We strongly encourage applicants from diverse gender, racial, and ethnic backgrounds to apply.


To Apply: Review of applications will begin on Apr 5, 2021. Completed applications should be sent to both An Nguyen (atnguyen@oden.utexas.edu) and Dave Sutherland (dsuth@uoregon.edu) and should include: (1) a curriculum vitae; (2) a cover letter that explains precisely how your research background, qualifications, and interdisciplinary experience could contribute to the aims of GRISO; (3) the names and contact information of three recommenders; (4) a stated preference for one location (University of Texas at Austin or University of Oregon) or justify the choice of both if you could conceive of working at either institution. Start date in Fall 2021 is preferred, although it is flexible.
