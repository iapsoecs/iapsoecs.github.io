We have an open PhD position on the current and future efficiency of the Arctic Ocean carbon sink. We are looking for a person with a solid background in marine biogeochemistry/oceanography. The PhD fellow will assess present and future carbon storage in the Arctic Ocean and examine how changes in ocean circulation and mixing, particularly those resulting from sea-ice decline, influence the ocean’s capacity to absorb and retain carbon. The project will combine field measurements—such as biogeochemical observations and transient tracers—with outputs from advanced numerical models.

Application deadline: February 4th.

 

The PhD candidate is expected to participate in a research cruise to the Arctic Ocean commencing late July 2026

 

The PhD Fellowship is associated with Arctic Ocean 2050, a major ten‑year Norwegian research program aimed at advancing our understanding of the present state and future evolution of the Arctic Ocean. The program brings together 18 Norwegian partners and combines interdisciplinary fieldwork, innovation, and cutting-edge ocean and climate modelling. Core activities include multiple research cruises and extensive cross-institutional collaboration.

 

This position offers an excellent opportunity for candidates interested in climate science, oceanography, biogeochemistry, and Earth system processes, and who wish to contribute to our understanding of one of the world’s most rapidly changing regions. Beyond participation in the 2026 research cruise, The PhD candidate is expected to actively engage in project activities—including meetings, research schools, outreach events, and collaboration within the broader Arctic Ocean 2050 network. The candidate will also become part of the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research, Norway’s leading climate research environment.
