## Job Description

We seek a talented post-doctoral scientist to carry out research to better understand how the AMOC has changed in the past, and how it may change in the future. This research is a component of the international research projects EPOC (https://epoc-eu.org/) and TipESM (https://www.tipesm.eu/). The post will be based in the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, within the Department of Meteorology.

You will improve our understanding of how changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) can affect the North Atlantic Ocean, and whether the resulting AMOC “fingerprints” are sensitive to model resolution, and work to understand the processes shaping the response of AMOC to future climate change, including the interactions with Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

The position is available to start immediately, ending on 31st Dec 2027.

 

You will have:

* Have, or shortly expect to receive, a PhD or equivalent research experience in physical or mathematical sciences
* Strong scientific analytical ability, creativity, and self-motivation
* Experience of analysing output from climate models or similar datasets
* Good communication skills and the ability to maintain productive collaborations


Please note that candidates are required to be based in Reading for the entire duration of the contract.
Closing date: 27/04/2025
Interviews will be held: 09/05/2025
