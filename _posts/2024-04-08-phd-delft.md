I am seeking a Ph.D. student to work on the topic of ocean and sea ice
modeling at TU Delft in the Netherlands. The position is fully funded for 4
years and has a flexible starting date.

As part of this project, the Ph.D. candidate will use a model of ocean
turbulence coupled with a discrete element model of sea ice to explore how
their interactions impact the breakage, melt, and freezing of the sea ice
pack. A more detailed description of the project, requirements and
conditions of employment can be found here.
