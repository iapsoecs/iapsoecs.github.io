Below a postdoctoral fellowship offer for one year at LOG in France and one year at Takuvik in Quebec, Canada to develop simulations of the lidar signal in the ocean. 

**Postdoctoral Fellowship Position in Lidar Applications to Ocean Color**

A  two-year  postdoctoral  position  is  jointly  proposed  by  the  Laboratory  of  Oceanology  and  Geosciences 
LOG (Wimereux, France) and the Takuvik International Research Laboratory (Université Laval and CNRS, 
Canada) on the simulation of the lidar signal in the ocean. The position is jointly funded by Université du 
Littoral-Côte d’Opale and the Institut France-Québec Maritime. 

Objectives 
Recent studies showed the feasibility to study the ocean using space-borne lidars. However no dedicated 
space-borne oceanic profiling lidar exists or is in plan to be launched in the near-future. For the preparation 
of  such  a  space  mission  it  is  necessary  to  characterize  the  propagation  of  the  lidar  signal  through  the  
atmosphere and the ocean. Only few studies on this topic have been published in recent years. Monte-Carlo 
simulations are used to study the interaction of the lidar signal with the marine particles from space. These 
studies  are  preliminary  and  require  to  include  more  contributions  from  diverse  optically-active  marine  
constituents. This will help studying the impact of the constituents on the shape and magnitude of the lidar 
signal over the water column and to characterize the specifications of a space-borne oceanic profiling lidar. 
The successful candidate will use published lidar simulators to enhance their capabilities. Sensitivity studies 
will be performed on the lidar signal and magnitude depending of the concentrations of the optically-active 
constituents or depending of the specifications of a space-borne oceanic profiling lidar. The candidate will 
study the vertical depth reached by a space-borne lidar, and will include the inelastic scattering (fluorescence, 
Raman, Brillouin) and explore multispectral detection. Applications from drones may be examined as well. 
These studies will help defining possible future space-borne oceanic profiling lidars. 

Qualifications:    PhD  degree  in  optics  or  remote  sensing.  Expertise  in  lidar  would  be  ideal  but  is  not  
mandatory. 

Technical skills required: Optics, programming (matlab, python, C), remote sensing, onte-Carlo 
simulation, radiative transfer  

Application closure date: November 1, 2021 

Start date: January 1st 2022 

Position Length: two years with a one-year mandatory period at LOG in 2022 and a one-year mandatory 
period at Takuvik in 2023. 

Salary: 2500€ gross monthly for the period at LOG; CAD$ for the period at Takuvik 

Location: The candidate will spend one year in 2022 at LOG and then one year at Takuvik in 2023.  
LOG, 32 avenue Foch, 62930 Wimereux, France ; Takuvik
