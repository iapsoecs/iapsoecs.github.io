The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) is a government and research organization providing national weather and climate services, with extensive research activities in atmospheric sciences including numerical weather prediction, air quality and climate change; marine research; polar research; and space research. There are currently 360 members of research staff at FMI; 30 professors, and more than 150 Ph.D. level scientists.

 

The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) seeks talented and motivated academics who have completed their doctoral degree within the last ten years, and have since accrued academic and other relevant qualifications. FMI has introduced a tenure track programme for service and research personnel to provide consistent, competitive and attractive career paths.

Successful applicants will be employed as tenure track professors, and they have permanent senior researcher positions. The duration of the initial tenure track professor’s employment contract is three years. Continuation on a second fixed-term tenure track professor’s contract depends on successful fulfilment of predefined criteria; after which a permanent position as research professor may be offered. Academic qualifications and experience will be considered. Additional merit will be given for demonstrating the ability to acquire research funding, utilization of research in service development, working abroad, and international exposure.

 

FMI will allocate these four tenure track positions to areas which are of strategic importance for the future success of the institute. Applicants are expected to have a significant contribution to one of these essential areas.
