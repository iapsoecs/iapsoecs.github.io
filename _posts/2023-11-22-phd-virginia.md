The Biogeochemistry Across Boundaries (B.A.B.) Lab (https://colombo-manuel.github.io), P.I. Manuel Colombo, is seeking a M.Sc. and/or Ph.D. student(s) interested in conducting research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) and William & Mary, starting in Fall 2024. The successful candidate will work primarily studying how iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) oxides influence organic carbon (OC) cycling in the Amazon River and adjacent shelf environment. This work will include the analysis of trace element speciation and Mn and Fe-bounded OC in multiple sediment cores, suspended sediments and porewater samples collected from the low Amazon basin to the Suriname continental shelf following the northward spreading of Amazon mudbanks along the shelf. The prospective student will be working in the brand new B.A.B. Lab facility, integrating innovative sample processing and analytical strategies for both trace elements and OC as well as other biomarkers.

The position is funded for a minimum of 2.5 / 5 years (M.Sc. / Ph.D.) including a 12-month stipend, tuition waiver and health insurance; for more information, please see Opportunities (https://colombo-manuel.github.io/opportunities/).

Qualifications:

The student should be highly self-motivated, curious, detail-oriented and have very good writing and verbal communication skills, as well as the ability to work independently and collaboratively.

The position requires a bachelor's or master's degree in oceanography, chemistry, biology, environmental science, engineering, or a related field. Given the strong laboratory component of the project, having experience working in a lab environment and processing samples (e.g., sediments, water, suspended matter, biological tissues, etc.) is beneficial. Programming skills (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB) and some knowledge of analytical chemistry are desirable, but most importantly being eager to learn.

Application:

If interested, please contact Manuel Colombo (https://colombo-manuel.github.io/contact/) as soon as possible to go over the M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs at VIMS and W&M, the timeline and the research topic. Please include in your email (subject line 'Prospective student') your CV, unofficial transcripts, and a cover letter stating your research interests and how those align with the 'Amazon River project' specifically, and the lab at large.

About The Virginia Institute of Marine Science:

Chartered in 1940, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) (https://www.vims.edu/index.php) is currently among the largest marine research and education centers in the United States. VIMS has a three-part mission to conduct interdisciplinary research in coastal ocean and estuarine science, educate students and citizens, and provide advisory service to policy makers, industry, and the public. The School of Marine Science (SMS; M.A., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees) at VIMS is the graduate school in marine science for William & Mary, the second oldest university in the United States. Graduate students have an unparalleled opportunity to conduct research within the three VIMS academic sections (Coastal & Ocean Processes, Ecosystem Health, and Natural Resources), extending from inland watersheds to the open ocean. VIMS currently employs more than 500 faculty, staff and students at three different campuses; with a graduate student body of approximately 90-100 at any given year, the faculty-to-student ratio in the School of Marine Science allows for a small and dedicated class size, at an average of 7-10 students per class.
