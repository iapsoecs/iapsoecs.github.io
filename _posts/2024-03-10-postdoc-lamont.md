The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Scientist position in the McKinley Ocean Carbon Group. 

The position will focus on understanding the mechanisms of transport and storage of anthropogenic carbon (Cant) in the North Atlantic is mediated by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation as represented in CMIP6 Earth System Models. Evaluation of CMIP6 against new estimates from direct observations will allow the candidate to place constraints on future Cant uptake and storage as estimated by the CMIP6 suite. Prior experience with oceanography, carbon cycling, and/or ocean and climate models is preferred.

The candidate will have the opportunity to build strong links with the many collaborators supported across two NSF / NERC funded projects on this topic. In Europe, collaborators at National Oceanography Center and the University of Exeter in the UK will lead estimates of Cant transports across the RAPID and OSNAP sections. In the US, collaborators at the University of Miami will make measurements in Florida Straits, at Georgia Tech will analyze OSNAP data, and at MIT and JPL will assess Cant transports in a range of models.

Candidates should have completed or be nearing completion of a PhD in ocean and climate science, or a closely related field. Excellent communication, interpersonal and organizational skills and ability to use independent judgment required. Evidence of the ability to conduct and publish high quality research is required.

The proposed start date is July 1, 2024, with some flexibility. Appointments will be for 1-year, with continuation pending funding and progress.

Search will remain open for at least 30 days after the ad appears and will continue until the positions are filled.

Please discuss your specific interest in this project in the cover letter.
