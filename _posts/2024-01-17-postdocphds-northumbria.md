We are advertising one PostDoc in Polar Oceanography (3 years) and 2 PhD positions (in Polar Oceanography and Glaciology, 3.5 years at Northumbria University).

All positions are linked to NERC funded project "Rethinking Antarctic sea level projections" led by Christopher Bull and Ronja Reese in collaboration with Robin Smith (University of Reading), Adrian Jenkins (Northumbria University) and Helene Seroussi (Dartmouth College, USA). The aim of this work is to develop new understanding of how the large-scale climate drivers influence the access of warm waters to the ice shelves leading to ice loss in Antarctica. Our aim then is to reduce uncertainty in estimates of future Antarctic ice loss.

The post-doc closes on 31st January 2024 and the PhD projects on the 11th January (UK).

Northumbria is establishing itself as a Peak of Excellence in studying the future of ice sheets and glaciers. International applicants are very welcome and we particularly encourage applications from minority groups. We wish to be flexible where it supports a diverse and inclusive research environment.
Newcastle Upon Tyne might not be known to many but we like it! Itâ€™s close to the coast, has loads of art, renowned Northumberland national parks and UK-famous night life.
