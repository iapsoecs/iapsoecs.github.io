The Wozniak marine organic geochemistry lab is seeking a highly motivated
graduate student (MS or PhD) to join an NSF-funded collaborative project
examining the organic biogeochemistry of surfactants at the air-sea
interface. The student will be advised by Dr. Andrew Wozniak at the
University of Delaware's, School of Marine Science and Policy in Lewes, DE
with an expected start date of June 2022. Tuition and a competitive student
stipend will be offered for the 3-year duration of the project.

Applicants holding bachelor's or master's degrees in chemistry,
geosciences, environmental science, marine science, or related fields are
desired. Applicants having experience with chemistry coursework, dissolved
organic matter characterization (including spectroscopic and mass
spectrometric techniques listed above), or DNA sequencing techniques are
desired though all motivated individuals are encouraged to apply.
Individuals from all backgrounds will be considered; those from groups
underrepresented in STEM fields are especially encouraged to apply.

Interested students should email Dr. Andrew Wozniak (awozniak@udel.edu)
