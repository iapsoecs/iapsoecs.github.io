We seek a graduate student interested in chemical oceanography / ocean biogeochemistry to join a NOAA funded project at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa. The 3-year project involves collating available biogeochemical profiling float data, checking for and correcting any biases against long-term shipboard measurements, and using these new datasets to understand how the Southern Ocean oxygen, carbon, and nutrient contents are changing. The graduate student will also interact and meet with co-PIs Dr. Nancy Williams (University of South Florida) and Dr. Andrea Fassbender (NOAA-PMEL). More broadly, I am looking for someone who would like to explore how we measure, analyze, and understand oxygen and carbon cycles in the ocean. While this initial project is focused on analysis of existing datasets, opportunities for lab and field work in our group will also be present.

Desired qualifications: Bachelor’s degree in a science or engineering discipline. Experience in or willingness to learn a coding language (Matlab or Python) for data analysis.
