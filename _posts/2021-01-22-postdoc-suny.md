The Atmospheric Sciences Research Center at the State University of New York at Albany has an opening for a highly-motivated Postdoctoral Researcher to develop state-of-the-art measurements of air-sea interaction for a project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Wind Energy Technology Office. The project involves development of an autonomous system for turbulent air-sea fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat using the eddy covariance technique that will be integrated onto a floating buoy-based lidar platform. This capability will support research related to offshore wind energy and will also have application to basic studies of air-sea interaction physics. 

The successful candidate will assist with various aspects of system design, fabrication, laboratory testing and field trials, and will process and analyze data using Matlab or similar software, present results at scientific conferences, and publish in peer-reviewed journals. Motivated candidates with an interest in geophysical fluid mechanics, turbulence, air-sea interaction and renewable energy with an emphasis on offshore wind are encouraged to apply.

Minimum Qualifications 

    PhD degree in engineering or physical sciences (e.g., atmospheric sciences, oceanography) or a related discipline  
    Interest and experience in field work and/or instrumentation

Additional Qualifications (beneficial but not required) 

    experience with field observations, data acquisition and processing
    willingness to travel 

Application Procedure 

Candidates should contact Dr. Scott Miller (smiller@albany.edu) or Dr. Jeff Freedman (jfreedman@albany.edu) by email before applying. 

Salary: $65K

Earliest Start Date: Feb 1 2022

Duration: 1 year, with possibility to extend to 2+ years 

Application Deadline: the position will remain open until filled
