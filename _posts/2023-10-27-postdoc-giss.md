Postdoc/Research Scientist Position in Oceanography

The Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research II (GESTAR II) consortium at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) invites applications for a postdoctoral research position in the field of oceanography, marine science, or a closely related field. Research will be conducted as part of the NASA Ocean Ecology Laboratory.

GSFC’s Ocean Ecology Laboratory (OEL) advances Earth System Science by managing ocean and atmospheric satellite climate data records, developing new remote sensing, field, laboratory, and modeling methods, and by conducting innovative research in ocean biogeochemistry and atmospheric composition and processes.

We are seeking a postdoc/research scientist to perform research related to river and coastal ocean numerical model development with the goal of improving the transport and transformation of carbon and nutrients from land to the ocean. The overarching goal is to improve existing global carbon stock and flux (organic and inorganic) products by linking existing land and ocean carbon based models, historical and cutting edge satellite tools, and a comprehensive in-situ database built under this project. An existing terrestrial biosphere model (Ecosystem Demography model, ED) combined with the Land-Use Harmonization (LUH) dataset provides fluxes of carbon and nutrients from land to rivers under varying land use and land cover change scenarios. The newly developed River-Estuary model transports and transforms aqueous forms of carbon and nutrients to represent the lateral fluxes of carbon and nutrients from rivers to the NASA Ocean Biogeochemical Model (NOBM). The successful candidate will also need to prepare and/or contribute to reports and manuscripts.

Required Qualifications:

    B.A. or B.S. degree in the natural sciences and Ph.D. in hydrology, oceanography, marine science, or closely related field

    Experience in Fortran, and MATLAB and/or python

    Knowledge and understanding of aquatic biogeochemistry and the carbon cycle

    Ability and experience in communicating results in project meetings, scientific meeting presentations, and peer-reviewed journal articles

    Experience and/or openness to interacting and communicating directly with stakeholders 

Preferred Qualifications:

    Experience with biogeochemical modeling development and/or numerical modeling of aquatic processes

    Experience with HPC environments

    Database construction and management 

    Knowledge in geospatial statistical techniques

    Experience and success working in multi-disciplinary teams										

The successful candidate will join the GESTAR II Consortium which supports over 140 researchers based primarily at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. GESTAR II researchers work to create extensive opportunities for breakthroughs in earth and atmospheric science research, carrying out observational, experimental and theoretical research in support of NASA strategic Earth Science mission objectives.

Goddard’s Earth Science Division is home to about 200 civil servants and over 1200 collaborating researchers and support personnel, dedicated to studying the Earth as an integrated system that includes the atmosphere, oceans, biosphere, cryosphere, and geosphere. The Division operates as a component of the Sciences and Exploration Directorate that collaborate on interdisciplinary research with the Astrophysics Science, Heliophysics Science, and Solar System Exploration Divisions.

The nominal starting date is Winter, 2024, but alternate dates are possible depending on availability. 

Candidates should provide a cover letter, CV (including publication list) and a 3-page statement of research interests. Short-listed candidates will be asked to supply three letters of reference at a later date. All materials and inquiries should be sent by email Subject line: Task 192: Researcher Position to: Halley Thompson (halleyt@umbc.edu)

Completed applications received by November 20, 2023 will receive full consideration, however the posting will remain open until the position is filled.

Salary and benefits are competitive, commensurate with experience and qualifications. The GESTAR II consortium and NASA/GSFC are committed to building a diverse research community and encourages applications from women, racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities and veterans. All GESTAR II institutions are Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity Employers.
