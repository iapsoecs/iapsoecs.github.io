## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
We are looking for a Post-Doc or Junior Scientist at the Institute for Earth System Prediction (IESP). We invite candidates with a strong background in physical and/or computational sciences to join our team. The successful candidate will be part of the regional ocean data assimilation team in the Regional Ocean Forecasting Systems (ROFS) division. The division carries out research activities to improve the short-term forecasting and the reanalysis systems in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The regional systems maintained by the division are part of the Copernicus Marine Service. The incumbent will be responsible for developing data assimilation and machine learning techniques to improve the ocean estimates using space-borne Earth Observations.

At CMCC you will find a strong, professional environment. Join an inclusive community that values diversity, where every voice is heard and respected. Help foster a culture of innovation and societal change, where individuals from all backgrounds can thrive and succeed.

To learn more about this opportunity and submit your application, please refer to the following:
