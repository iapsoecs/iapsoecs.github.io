TITLE: The turbulent life of rotating downslope intruding gravity currents (TUBE)

DESCRIPTION: Predicting the response to natural and anthropogenic forcing of Earth’s climate is one of today’s
greatest challenges. It crucially depends on our understanding of the ocean dynamics over a large
variety of interacting scales in time and space. The abyssal waters are mainly fed by oceanic
overflows, which are bottom-trapped dense gravity currents originating in semi-enclosed basins
or on continental shelves (Marshall & Schott 1999). Their descent on the continental slope involve
boundary layers, high shears and density gradients, instabilities, breaking internal waves and the
generation of sub-mesoscale vortices at [km] scale and smaller. The resulting mixing influences the
final stabilisation depth of the water mass, its density and transport, which controls the whole
convection process.
Water mass mixing is the main mechanism that drives energy dissipation in the ocean and is related to
turbulent sub-mesoscale processes, such as those produced by gravity currents, but they are still poorly understood.
The main goal of the PhD is to identify and quantify the relevant processes, such as turbulence
production, induced by intruding rotating gravity currents.

And the detailed description of the project is attached with this mail.

Methods will be based on laboratory experiments in the Coriolis rotating Platform (http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/web//spip.php?article757), the largest in the world,
and on numerical simulations using the CROCO model ( [ http://www.croco-ocean.org/ | http://www.croco-ocean.org/ ] ).
Comparison between the experimental and numerical data will serve to test and validate the non-hydrostatic CROCO model.
The candidate will be supervised by Eletta Negretti, Achim Wirth and Joël Sommeria, all CNRS researchers.

Potential candidates should send an Email to [ mailto:eletta.negretti@legi.cnrs.fr | eletta.negretti@legi.cnrs.fr ] , and then send their candidature on the web site
