# About the research project

Our models do well at forecasting tomorrow's weather, but how well can they predict the weather a decade from now? Where will the rain be heavier? Where will it be windier? We know that the world is warming, but the impact

that this has on things like rainfall is complex and can only be addressed by running the models at higher resolution. The ocean is a key component in the weather, for example providing the source of energy for tropical cyclones. There is, however, still much that we don't understand about how the ocean and atmosphere interact at the small scales resolved by our latest weather models. One important aspect of this interaction is the way that heat moves between the atmosphere and the upper ocean. To improve our ability to forecast weather in the future, our ocean models need to improve the way they represent how heat is drawn from, and returned to, the air above.

This PhD project will investigate where and how weather systems in the tropics impact, and are impacted by, the ocean's "weather" – the "mesoscale" features like eddies and jets the fill much of the ocean. Your research will involve running state of the art numerical models on the Australian national supercomputer, together with analysing the latest observations of the atmosphere and ocean.

The position is funded by Australia's Centre of Excellence in 21st Century Weather - an active community of atmosphere and ocean scientists spread across 5 different Australian universities. You will be based at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Science in Hobart, but will have multiple opportunities to collaborate nationally and internationally with leading scientists from the partners of the Centre.
