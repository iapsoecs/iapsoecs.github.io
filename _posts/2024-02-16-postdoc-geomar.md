The Synergy Project WHIRLS funded by the European Research Council (ERC) researches the impacts of ocean fine-scale whirls on climate and ecosystems. WHIRLS will use a synergistic and interdisciplinary approach to study fine-scale processes across a continuum of scales (1â€“ 100 km) and assess their impacts on air-sea exchange and marine biogeochemistry and biodiversity. The focus is on the Agulhas Current System around South Africa as a global hotspot of eddy activity, ocean-atmosphere heat exchange, and marine productivity and diversity. It is also a region that plays a key role for the global ocean circulation in the framework of a changing climate. Multiple coordinated observing strategies, including research vessels and a large ensemble of autonomous platforms, will collect physical, chemical, and biological datasets across scales. These data will be supplemented by high-resolution models of the ocean and the atmosphere, as well as the latest data science methodologies. WHIRLS will improve the understanding of fine-scale processes and its representation in future earth system models for better predictions and projections of the future climate. WHIRLS consists of 4 partners in France, Sweden, South Africa, and Germany.

We are seeking a highly motivated and skilled post-doctoral researcher with demonstrated expertise in numerical ocean and/or atmospheric modelling. The candidate will (i) set up and perform coupled ocean-atmosphere models down to the km-scale, (ii) study the role of the oceanic (sub)mesoscale for air-sea fluxes, the oceanic uptake of heat and tracers, and for weather and climate. The candidate will work in a team of scientists and numerical modellers at GEOMAR, but also in the framework of international collaborators within WHIRLS.
