We are looking for a PhD student to join Celine Heuze's group in
Gothenburg, Sweden (collaboration with Chalmers University of Technology in
Gothenburg, Sweden), to work on my Swedish National Space Agency-funded
project “Monitoring Arctic polynyas from Space”.

Deadline for application = 7 Feb 2023.

Keep reading if you have a background in
climatology/oceanography/glaciology/meteorology or equivalent and
experience with data analysis.

The project is 100% funded for 4 years (+1 up to one year extension if the
student chooses to teach), and is about Arctic polynyas, or openings in the
Arctic sea ice caused by winds and/or the ocean.
PhDs are by publication here, with 3 publications as first author
recommended, hence the 3 questions:
- All around the Arctic, for both summer and winter, which mechanism opens
which polynya and how predictable is it?
- Same question about their maintenance: thermodynamics or dynamics, and are
their changes of shape / size / position predictable?
- How much of an impact do Arctic polynyas have on the weather locally, and
can we use this information to improve our retrievals?
In practice, students are encouraged to start generating their own research
question during their PhD, so the above questions are only suggestions.
Candidates interested in dense water formation and ventilation would be
most welcome (hint).

The project relies on already-existing remote sensing products; no
experience with remote sensing is required, but the candidate needs strong
data analysis skills.

The successful candidate will have opportunities to join ship-based field
campaigns to the Arctic, but does not have to if they do not want to.

The position is in collaboration with Chalmers University of Technology
(also in Gothenburg), and includes a visit to project partners in Hokkaido
University, Japan.


Practicalities:
Salaries start at 29 kSEK per month. Costs of living will of course vary
from person to person, but count 5 to 10 kSEK per month for a nice
apartment.

28 days of holiday per year if the person is under 30 years old, and up to
35 days if older.

For tax reasons, the PhD student has to be registered as living in Sweden.

Starting date is either by 1st May or September 2023. The immigration
office can be extremely slow, so the dates are not strict. You can apply as
long as you will have completed your Master’s degree by the agreed start
date.

The application has to be submitted online latest on 7 February 2023 at:
shorturl.at/chEMR

Interviews will take place in the second half of February and early March
2023. All applicants will be informed of the outcome latest by mid-March
2023.

For more information, check the ad on the GU website or email me. Do not
email me your application; only applications submitted via the official
portal can be considered.
