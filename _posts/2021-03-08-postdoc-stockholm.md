We have an exciting PhD position available at the Department of Meteorology, Stockholm University. The position addresses dynamics and lifecycle of coastal upwelling and associated offshore transport in different regimes (varying topography, stratification, wind forcing). The motivation for the study lies in the well monitored but yet not well understood coastal upwelling processes in the Baltic Sea and their response to the climate change, an urgent question due to the importance of upwelling for the marine ecosystem and coastal societies. However, the study can be formulated in a a much wider context e.g., comparing different upwelling regimes worldwide.

The student will begin with a study using theory and idealized numerical ocean model. Thereafter the student will shape the the focus of the project according to their own interests. We offer access to sea-going infrastructure as well as high performance computing infrastructure, and a possibility for collaboration with the Stockholm University Baltic Sea Centre, the Bolin Centre for Climate Research and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.

The PhD position closes for applications March 21, 2021.
