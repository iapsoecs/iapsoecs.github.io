The main objective of the project WINDSCOOP is to determine the impact of winds and oceanic processes on the sea ice cover at decadal to multi-decadal timescales. This will improve our understanding of the variability of the ice extent at those timescales and ultimately our ability to identify the origin of recent changes in sea ice extent and to predict future ones.

In this framework, applications are open for the following position:

Post-doctoral researcher

Starting date: Ideally before December 1 2022 but can be negotiated
Full time position for 24 months with possibility to extend to 36 months

Net monthly salary: 2300-2500 € (depending on seniority - this includes social insurance). Transportation to and from the workplace is covered.
Location: Earth and Life Institute, Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium

The candidates must not have spent more than 2 years in Belgium over the last 3 years and should not have obtained their PhD more than 6 years before the starting date of the grant.

The post-doctoral scientist will be responsible for performing and analysing sensitivity experiments with the ocean model NEMO driven by atmospheric reanalyses and with the climate model EcEarth to estimate the impact of winds and oceanic processes on the sea ice cover. In particular, he/she will perform experiments in which the model winds will be nudged to observed winds. Both winds observations over the past decades and derived from a new reconstruction covering the past centuries will be used. Additional simulations in which the interactions with the ocean will be disabled will allow disentangling the direct contribution of the winds to sea ice changes from the one due to interactions with the ocean. On the basis on those experiments and analyses, the role of winds and of the feedbacks between ocean and sea ice in past and recent sea ice changes will be determined and quantified.

Required qualifications:

- To have a PhD in climatology or related field;
- To have published in peer-reviewed international journals;
- To have strong experience in programming and in managing large data sets;
- To have demonstrated good verbal and written communication skills in English;
- To have interest in working in a multidisciplinary team environment.

Previous experience in polar climate dynamics or in modelling is an asset.

Applicants should send an e-mail to Hugues Goosse (hugues.goosse@uclouvain.be) including (i) a statement of research experience, qualification and interest, (ii) a complete CV including a list of publications, and (iii) the name of two scientists who would agree to send a letter of recommendation

Review of the applications will start September 15th and the call will remain open until the position is filled.
