**PhD opportunities in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science at UNSW, Sydney**

 

There are exciting opportunities for PhD projects in the Climate Change Research Centre and the School of Mathematics and Statistics at UNSW as part of the ARC Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science (ACEAS).

 

What: 

The goal of ACEAS is to help the world community prepare for climate risks emerging from East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean by integrating knowledge of the ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere and ecosystems, and their interplay. ACEAS is a national-scale, University-led centre for excellence in Antarctic science focused on this goal.

 

ACEAS is led by the University of Tasmania with a range of Australian and International Partners ( https://www.utas.edu.au/aceas ). UNSW, Sydney is a major node of ACEAS.

 

A range PhD of projects will be available at the UNSW node of ACEAS covering research areas such as: 

 - Ice-Ocean-Atmosphere interaction

 - Paleoclimate

 - Coupled Climate Modelling

 - Physical Oceanography

 - Ocean Biogeochemistry

 - Sea-Level Change

 - Environmental Data Science 

 

Students will be supported in applications for Australian Research Training Program (RTP) scholarships and top-up scholarships will bring the stipend to $35K-$40K (tax free).

 

Projects are available with ACEAS-UNSW investigators: Associate Professors Laurie Menviel, Ian Goodwin and Jan Zika and Professors Matthew England, Alex Sen Gupta and John Church and will be jointly supervised with investigators across ACEAS.

 

Who: 

We are looking for prospective students holding or expecting to hold a first class Honours Degree (or equivalent) in a quantitative subject such as mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering or geosciences such as atmospheric science, glaciology or oceanography. 

 

When:

UNSW has 3 PhD application rounds per year ( https://research.unsw.edu.au/key-dates ). Students wanting to start in term 1 2022 should apply by the 27th of August (please contact us ASAP if you are interested in this round). 

 

Due to ongoing COVID-19 travel restrictions we are initially focusing on Australian based students for the August round. We also welcome expressions of interest from both domestic and international candidates looking to apply for future rounds.

 

Please send expressions including a short CV and academic transcript to Associate Professor Jan Zika (j.zika@unsw.edu.au).
