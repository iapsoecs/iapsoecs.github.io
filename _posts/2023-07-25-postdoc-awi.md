We are seeking to fill a postdoctoral position in the topic "Understanding Antarctic Sea Ice: Variability, Changes and Future Development".

The project, funded by the German Research Council (DFG) within the priority program "Antarctic Research with Comparative Investigations in the Arctic Ice Areas", aims at understanding the variability of Antarctic sea ice mass and its interaction with the atmosphere and the ocean. It will use field and remote sensing observations in the Weddell Sea, conduct sensitivity studies, and provide insights into potential changes in Antarctic sea ice under future warming climate scenarios.

The project is embedded in the Young Investigator and Bridge Group between the Alfred Wegener Institute and the University of Hamburg, with the option to work at either or both locations.

The deadline for applications is 13 August 2023, with a preferred start date before the end of this year.

We are looking forward to your applications!
