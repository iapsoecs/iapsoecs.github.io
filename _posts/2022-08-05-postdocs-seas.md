About The University of Bergen (UiB) 

The University of Bergen is a renowned educational and research institution, organised into seven faculties and approximately 54 institutes and academic centres. 

The University of Bergen (UiB) is Norway’s largest marine university, with research and education of a high international standard and several world leading research environments.

Marine collaboration among the academic, business, government, and civil society (e.g., NGOs) sectors is particularly strong in the Bergen region, given the city’s long history as a maritime port and trading centre. UiB’s campus-area, Marineholmen, is a marine hotspot in Europe, with over 150 companies and organisations collaborating in seafood, energy, subsea technology, and other maritime activities. Many of these are partners of the SEAS programme.
