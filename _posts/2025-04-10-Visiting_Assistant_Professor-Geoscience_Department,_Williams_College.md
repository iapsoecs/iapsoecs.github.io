The Geosciences Department at Williams College invites applications for a 3-year visiting assistant professor position in the broad fields of climate, oceanography, and/or geomorphology, beginning 1 July 2025.

We are a student-centered department of teacher-scholars, actively engaged in research and dedicated to broadening participation in the geosciences. Our department offers a wide range of courses covering oceans and climate, sediments and life, and solid-earth topics. We seek a colleague who is committed to inclusive undergraduate education in classroom, lab, and field settings, and to engaging a diverse population of students.

The successful candidate will teach one or two courses per semester, depending on course size and structure. During the first year, this will include 100-level Oceanography in Fall 2025 and in Spring 2026 a 200- or 300-level course in geomorphology and/or the climate system for geosciences majors (suitable for a liberal arts curriculum). Course offerings in the subsequent two years will depend on departmental and curricular needs as well as the specific expertise of the individual hired. Our new colleague will also have opportunities to work with and mentor undergraduate research students; internal funds are available to support student-faculty research.

The Geosciences Department (https://geosciences.williams.edu/) is committed to providing excellent and inclusive geoscience education for all students, including majors and those who take our classes as liberal arts electives. Preferred applicants will have a Ph.D. completed by the time of appointment, demonstrated teaching experience, and demonstrated commitment to teaching, mentoring and advising a diverse population of students.
