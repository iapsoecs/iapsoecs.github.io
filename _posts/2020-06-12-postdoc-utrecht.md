**Postdoc position in dispersal simulation of floating material in satellite-derived ocean currents**

The ocean plays an important role in global society, supporting fisheries, shipping and tourism. At the same time, the ocean is under threat from pollution such as plastics and oil spills. Furthermore, parts of especially the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean are inundated with sargassum seaweeds. Oil, plastics and sargassum are all floating materials that are carried by ocean currents, which means that predicting the impact of these requires not only knowledge of their sources but also of the oceanic currents.

In the World Ocean Circulation project, funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), we will collaborate within a large consortium including French, Norwegian, Italian, Spanish and Dutch partners to create a state-of-the-art data product of the upper-ocean circulation based on remote sensing products. This data product will be freely available for end-users in the marine and maritime sector, and within the project a number of use cases will be developed to use the data product to answer real world questions.

Utrecht Universityâ€™s involvement in the World Ocean Circulation project is to develop advanced algorithms for tracking plastic, oil and seaweed in these new satellite-derived ocean currents, focusing on the Tropical and North Atlantic Ocean, and for this purpose we are seeking a postdoctoral research associate. You will work with project engage users to adapt and improve published algorithms and implement these into the open-source OceanParcels framework, developed in-house.

During the project, you will be involved in:
- developing code to track floating oil, sargassum and plastics in the OceanParcels framework;
- work with other consortium partners to validate and improve the new upper-ocean circulation product;
- engage and interact with users to incorporate their operational needs into the code;
- writing and presenting the results to scientific peers, the general public and the media.

By the end of the project, you will have:
- a deep understanding of the transport of pollution and other floating material on the ocean surface;
- an extensive network within ESA, the European ocean remote sensing community, and project engaged users;
- further developed your skills to communicate your scientific results to a wide audience.

Qualifications
Our ideal candidate has a driven and collaborative spirit and:
- a PhD in Physics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics or a similar field;
- a proven affinity with physical oceanography and remote sensing;
- strong skills in python programming;
- the ability to cooperate within a wider and interdisciplinary research team;
- an excellent level of written and spoken English.

Preferably you also have a proven experience with software development practices such as version control and unit-testing, as well as High Performance Computing techniques and facilities.
