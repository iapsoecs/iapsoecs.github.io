The Ocean Modelling group within the Climate and Environmental Physics Division at the University of Bern invites applications for a postdoctoral position in the area of modeling marine heatwaves and compound extremes. The primary focus will be on assessing and attributing past and future changes in subsurface marine heatwaves, ocean biogeochemical compound extremes, and cross-boundary (land-ocean) compound extremes, quantifying associated feedbacks to the climate system, and investigating the potential of these extremes to trigger larger shifts or tipping points in the ocean’s physical-biogeochemical system. The candidate is also encouraged to pursue related topics and develop their own projects.

The project offers the opportunity to work with a comprehensive, fully coupled climate-carbon cycle Earth system model and collaborate with experts in ocean extremes and tipping points within the Horizon Europe TipESM project (https://www.tipesm.eu), the Climate and Environmental Physics Division and the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research. The successful candidate will actively contribute to the dynamic and expanding Ocean Modeling Group, presenting results at international scientific conferences and publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Employment conditions and remuneration are in accordance with the standards of the University of Bern, Switzerland. The initial appointment is for two years, with the potential for an additional year.

We are looking for an outstanding postdoctoral researcher with a PhD in oceanography, climate sciences, physics, mathematics, statistics, or related fields. Candidates with a strong background in climate modeling, programming, the analysis of large datasets, and ocean physics and biogeochemistry are preferred. The position requires interdisciplinary collaboration and the ability to work independently. Proficiency in English, both written and spoken, is essential.

Interested candidates should submit a single pdf-file containing a motivation letter, a CV, a publication list, a web link to the PhD thesis, and contact details for two references. Applications should be sent to Prof. Thomas Frölicher (thomas.froelicher@unibe.ch). The review of applications begins on August 20, with the project start preferably in January 2025 or upon agreement.
