Join the dynamic and growing COASt research group at the University of St Andrews (https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/earth-sciences/research/centres/coast/). Two fully-funded PhDs are available for 2025 entry, focused on understanding fundamental dynamics of the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere, and their interactions. Deadlines 14th February.

"Westerly winds overturning oceans", supervised by Graeme MacGilchrist, Mike Byrne, and Simon Lee (all Earth and Environmental Sciences); explore the fundamental dynamics and interactions of the ocean and atmosphere circulation in the high latitude southern hemisphere. https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/scholarships/scholarships-catalogue/postgraduate-scholarships/world-leading-scholarship-03-earth-sciences/

"Groundwater under Antarctica: Impact of deep subglacial groundwater on Antarctic ocean circulation", supervised by TJ Young (Geography) and Graeme MacGilchrist (Earth and Environmental Sciences); explore the dynamics and pathways of groundwater under Antarctica and its impact on ice sheet and ocean flows. https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/scholarships/scholarships-catalogue/postgraduate-scholarships/world-leading-scholarship-05-geography-earth/
