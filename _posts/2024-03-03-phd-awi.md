Within my Emmy-Noether Young Investigator Group I am seeking to fill another PhD position in the field of "Antarctic sea ice mass budget".

The PhD project aims to enhance our understanding of the influence of the snowpack and its internal properties on the Antarctic sea ice mass budget. A comprehensive observational data set as well as vertical snow structures from snow models will be used to prescribe baseline conditions to improve the performance of the snow microwave radiative transfer model (SMRT) specific to Antarctic sea ice. The candidate will have the opportunity to participate in a ship-based expedition to gain hands-on experience in related sea ice and snow work.

More details on the tasks and requirements can be found here: https://jobs.awi.de/Vacancies/1613/Description/2

The project is embedded in my Young Investigator and Bridge Group between the Alfred Wegener Institute and the University of Hamburg, and will be based in Bremerhaven.

The deadline for applications is 20 March 2024, with a preferred start date no later than August 2024.

Please feel free to consider and/or share the job announcement to potential candidates in your areas.
