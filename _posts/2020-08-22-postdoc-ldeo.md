Postdoctoral Research Scientist, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of
Columbia University

The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University invites
applications for a Postdoctoral Research Scientist position in the Ocean
Carbon Group.

The position will focus on quantifying and reducing uncertainty in
extrapolations of sparse surface ocean pCO2 observations to global
coverage. The work will involve (1) evaluation of existing
extrapolations for surface ocean pCO2 within an existing testbed based
in Large Ensemble climate models, (2) developing new extrapolation
techniques that include explicit estimates of uncertainty, and (3)
assessing implications for scientific understanding of the mechanisms of
spatial and temporal variability in the ocean carbon sink. Prior
experience with oceanography, carbon cycle science and statistical
methods is strongly preferred.

The candidate will be expected to build strong links with collaborators
in the Department of Statistics and the Data Science Institute at
Columbia, and at NOAA?research laboratories.

Candidates should have completed or be nearing completion of a PhD in
oceanography. Excellent communication, interpersonal and organizational
skills and ability to use independent judgment required. Evidence of the
ability to conduct and publish high quality research is required.

Proposed start date is November 1st 2020, with some flexibility.
Appointments will be for 1-year, with continuation pending funding and
progress.

Search will remain open for at least 30 days after the ad appears and
will continue until the position is filled.
