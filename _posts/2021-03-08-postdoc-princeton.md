Postdoc in regional ocean model development

The Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program, in association with NOAA's
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), seeks a postdoctoral or more
senior researcher to work in the area of regional ocean model development.

This work involves further developing the regional capabilities of the MOM6
numerical ocean model, in both a forced ocean and a fully
coupled-to-atmosphere context. The candidate would focus on the development
of numerical methods and algorithms in the regional version of MOM6, and
would participate in the development of new regional applications to be used
to address questions in predictability, climate and Earth system model
down-scaling, ecosystem science and fisheries.

The ideal candidate has a strong background in one or more areas among
dynamical oceanography, dynamical meteorology, applied mathematics, or
numerical methods. Experience with scientific software development will be
advantageous in this research.

Candidates must have a Ph.D. in either oceanography, meteorology, applied
mathematics, physics, or a related field. Initial appointment is for one
year with the possibility of renewal subject to satisfactory performance and
available funding.

Complete applications, including a CV with a list of publications, a
statement of research interests (no more than 2 pages including references),
and contact information of 3 references should be submitted by March 31,
2021, 11:59 p.m. EST for full consideration. Princeton is interested in
candidates who, through their research, will contribute to the diversity and
excellence of the academic community.  Applicants should apply online
https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/19521.

For more information about the research project and application process,
please contact Robert Hallberg (robert.hallberg@noaa.gov), Charlie Stock (charles.stock@noaa.gov), or Alistair Adcroft (aadcroft@princeton.edu).
