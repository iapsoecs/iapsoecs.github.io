2 year post-doctoral position at CNRS, LOPS, Brest, France

MEDLEY project (MixED LayEr heterogeneitY, <http://medley.cnrs.fr>)

Position is open until filled, start date june 1st or later in 2021.

Deadline for applications is march 17th

For more information, CNRS web site to apply: <https://bit.ly/2MN4TPd>

 
This position is offered as part of the MEDLEY project (MixED LayEr heterogeneitY, medley.cnrs.fr). The postdoctoral fellow will characterize and quantify the spatial heterogeneities of the surface mixed layer in the North Atlantic, using in situ and satellite observations as well as high resolution numerical models. This study is motivated by the key role of ocean-atmosphere exchanges in the context of Earth's climate and global change. The transfers of heat, momentum and trace gases through the ocean surface are extremely complex and spatially heterogeneous. From ocean eddies at the 100 km-scale to fronts and filaments at the km-scale, spatial heterogeneities impact the thickness and properties of the mixed layer. MEDLEY aims to improve our understanding of the processes at play.
 

The postdoctoral fellow will use existing high resolution observations, such as the U.K. OSMOSIS dataset, thermo-salinographs, gliders and satellite datasets to characterize the spatial scales of heterogeneities at the ocean surface and over the depth of the mixed layer, in relation with the atmospheric forcing. These scales vary seasonally and interannually, and in-situ observations are sparse. Kilometer scale models such as the North Atlantic 1/60° (IGE Grenoble) or the 1/12° global models of the DRAKKAR consortium will be used to provide a four-dimensional context for the observations and to test dynamical balances over the depth of the ocean mixed layer. We will quantify the amplitudes, scales and causes of spatial heterogeneities in regions of relatively low eddy activity such as the North-East Atlantic, and compare these dynamics with those of energetic regions such as the Gulf Stream that have been surveyed more extensively. In the subpolar North Atlantic, flow-topography interactions have an imprint up to the ocean surface. Their role in creating horizontal gradients of mixed layer properties will be evaluated.
 

The candidate will hold a PhD in physical oceanography or atmospheric sciences, good knowledge of air-sea fluxes and boundary layer physics, and experience with analyzing large datasets from observations and/or numerical models. Programming skills and fluency with analysis software such as python or equivalent are required. The international collaboration context requires excellent written and spoken English, and the ability to work both independently and as part of a team.


The selected researcher will join the “Ocean and Climate” team at LOPS in Brest (www.umr-lops.fr). LOPS is a joint laboratory between CNRS, Ifremer, the University of Brest and the Institute of Research for Development. The Ocean and Climate team is leader in high resolution modelling as well as international ocean observation programs. The postdoctoral position is offered in the context of MEDLEY, <http://medley.cnrs.fr>), funded by the European Joint Programming Initiatives Ocean and Climate. Six post-doctoral researchers will contribute to MEDLEY, at CMCC (Italy), UCL (Belgium), NERSC (Norway), IGE (Grenoble, France) and LOPS. MEDLEY will provide a stimulating international environment and opportunities for short stays at the partner laboratories.
