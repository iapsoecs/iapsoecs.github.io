The Institute of Marine Sciences of the National Research Council (CNR-ISMAR, Italy) offers one fellowship for conducting research activities at the Unit of Lerici (La Spezia, Italy)under the framework of the Project “3D-PATHWAYS (CALYPSO- ONR Initiative)”, https://calypsodri.whoi.edu/

The focus of the fellowship is the “Development and application of analysis techniques to diagnose 2D and 3D passive transport from marine observations and models, with particular focus on the Lagrangian approach and on the combination of in situ and remote multiplatform datasets. Collaboration to the development and management of the Lagrangian observing system and to the management of marine datasets”, under the scientific responsibility of Dr. Maristella Berta.

The research fellow would join a highly experienced group in Lagrangian observations and methodologies, and will participate to the analysis of unique and interesting datasets that should result in a valuable set of publications. Collected datasets include multiplatform field campaigns in the Western Mediterranean Sea.

The position includes travels abroad for conferences and project meetings.

Degree in Engineering, Informatics, Mathematics, Physics, Environmental Sciences, Spatial Sciences and Technologies, Nautical Sciences or Oceanography, Marine Sciences and related fields. PhD is not strictly required.

The duration of the fellowship is one year (renewable).

deadline: June 3, 2021.
