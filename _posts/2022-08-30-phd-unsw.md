We are seeking a PhD student to undertake modelling of past warm climates of the Oligocene and Miocene. This is a 3-year scholarship at the Climate Change Research Centre, UNSW Sydney, Australia. This project will adapt a state-of-the-art climate model to past periods with warm polar climates, which serve as likely analogues of future climate change. Further details at this link:
