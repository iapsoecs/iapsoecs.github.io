In our Institute of Coastal Research we are looking for a scientist (PhD student) as soon as possible in the field of oceanography, environmental sciences, physics or a related natural science (e.g. environmental informatics, meteorology or any other earth system or climate science) for an initial period of 3 years.

You will be working in a newly formed young researcher’s group in the project “Multi compartment modeling - from emission to exposure (MCMEE)“. Goal of the project is to develop and implement a spatially highly resolved multi compartment model system for emerging organic pollutants. The MCMEE project aims at strengthening cooperation between different disciplines. Working in a team with frequent exchange and publishing scientific articles are essential parts of the work.
Your tasks

    - development of a marine emission model for organic pollutants
    - extension of an existing marine chemistry transport model for persistent organic pollutants
    - performing model studies on the fate of marine pollutants
    - investigations on bio-accumulation in the marine ecosystem

Your profile

    - at least a good master's degree in one of the above mentioned disciplines
    - very good knowledge of programming with Fortran, C or a script language (e.g. R., Python) as well as knowledge of Unix operating systems
    - experience in handling complex model codes is advantageous
    - experience in the application of complex model systems for atmosphere or ocean
    - knowledge of the chemistry of the atmosphere or the ocean, especially of long-lived organic pollutants, is advantageous
    - good communication skills in German and English, both professionally and beyond your own discipline

We offer

    - a vibrant scientific environment where you have the opportunity to collaborate closely with experts from multiple areas with combined expertise covering the full range from simulation and theory to experiments
    - exellent opportunities to develop your own research profile
    - opportunity to enroll in a PhD program at the University of Hamburg
    - a multinational work environment with over 1,000 colleagues from more than 50 nations
    - extensive options of professional training (i.e., expert seminars, language courses or leadership seminars)
    - flexible working hours and various models to ensure the compatibility of family and career
    - excellent infrastructure including modern workspaces
    - salary as per the collective wage agreement TV-AVH including further social benefits
