A three year postdoctoral position in physical oceanography is available at
the Australian National University. The project will use numerical models
to develop new understanding of the complex ocean processes that drive
Antarctic ice melt. This will lead to improved projections of future rates
of sea level rise stemming from Antarctica. Areas of particular interest
include understanding mechanisms of ocean heat transport towards ice shelf
cavities; investigating the sensitivity of melt to changes in winds, the
offshore heat reservoir, along-shelf ocean currents and sea ice; and
improving simulations of Antarctic ice shelf – ocean interactions,
including basal melt parameterisation.

This position is funded by the Australian Research Council Discovery
Project, ‘Improving projections of the risk of ocean-driven Antarctic ice
melt’, which is a collaboration between investigators at the Australian
National University (Dr Adele Morrison), University of New South Wales
(Prof. Matthew England) and University of Tasmania (Dr Madelaine Rosevear).
