Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is currently searching for a Research Associate I/II, to join the Physical Oceanography Department. This is a regular, full-time, non-exempt position, and is eligible for full benefits.



The successful candidate will join an interdisciplinary team building and sustaining a global array of profiling floats as part of the Argo program. Argo is an international program that collects information about the ocean using a fleet of robotic instruments that drift with the ocean currents and move up and down between the surface and a mid-water level. Each instrument (float) spends almost all its life below the surface. The interdisciplinary team at WHOI contributes to both the core physical oceanographic array that measures temperature and salinity, as well as the growing biogeochemical array which includes chemical and biological sensors to monitor ocean health and carbon uptake.
