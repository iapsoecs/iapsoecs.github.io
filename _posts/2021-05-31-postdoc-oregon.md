We are searching for a Postdoc Scholar to join Oregon State University (OSU) as part of the E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model) next-generation development activities.

The scholar will develop, evaluate, and implement a new parameterization for upper ocean mixing in E3SM, in collaboration with physical oceanographers at both OSU and Los Alamos National Lab. This parameterization will utilize recent developments in mass flux closures and surface wave-driven mixing, and it will be evaluated against data from large eddy simulations (LES). The postdoc will have some leeway to design/run these LES if desired.

The postdoc will be hosted by OSU’s Physics of Oceans and Atmospheres program in Corvallis OR, as part of the Ocean Mixing Group. They will be assisted by remote computational resources for E3SM development, as well as extensive resources at OSU.

The position is for two years, ideally beginning Fall 2021, has a salary of at least $55,000 plus benefits, and includes support for research costs (travel, publication etc.). OSU requires that applicants have been awarded a PhD within 5 years of starting the position. Candidates should have experience in–or the potential for– building an equitable and diverse scholarly environment within physical oceanography or in the wider academic community.

Apply via email to brodie.pearson [at] oregonstate.edu with a CV, a personal statement of research interests (max 2 pages), and contact information for three references.
