Climate Scientist
<https://www.climatecentral.org/what-we-do/jobs#climatescientist>

Use science to help transform the climate conversation. Climate Central seeks a highly motivated, creative, mid- to senior-level natural or social scientist to play a major role in our most ambitious effort to date. The mission: to make accurate and effective climate communications ubiquitous.

You will spearhead a strategic effort to build an unprecedented library of ways to link diverse local observations and events to climate science, impacts, and solutions for dissemination to social media, journalists, and other key messengers, in near real-time. Other audiences will include public and private decision-makers. This work will require efficient identification of authoritative literature in fields across the natural and social sciences; a nose for significant emerging science; and active research collaboration in high-value cases. Robust engagement with a broad research community will be critical.


Sea-Level Scientist
<https://www.climatecentral.org/what-we-do/jobs#sealevelrisescientist>

High-profile research that matters: Climate Central seeks a highly productive junior-to-mid-career natural or social scientist dedicated to making a strong societal impact. Top candidates will be creative and quantitative thinkers; prolific, independent generators of top-quality scientific manuscripts; and fluent in written, spoken, and visual communications for broader audiences. This is an opportunity to publish numerous papers from a platform promoting strong public attention for the best reasons.  Candidates don't need to be sea-level experts already; it's more important that they have strong aptitude, are driven to have a big impact on the climate conversation, and are eager for a research and work agenda shaped accordingly. The scientist will sit within Climate Central’s nationally recognized sea-level rise program and conduct critical research, writing and outreach for our U.S. and global work.


About Climate Central

Climate Central is an independent group of scientists and science translators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people’s lives. We use science, big data, and tech to generate thousands of local storylines and compelling visuals that make climate change relevant and show what can be done about it.  Climate Central’s sea-level rise program is a recognized leader in both climate science and communication. Our peer-reviewed research has been downloaded and accessed half-a-million times; our October 2019 paper in Nature Communications garnered more media and online attention than any other climate-science publication in 2019 and for at least the seven preceding years. Our research, web tools and expert perspectives have appeared in more than 15,000 stories ranging from covers of the New York Times to local TV news features to China Daily to The Hindu. Our web assets have won more than 250 million page views, including wide and extensive use of our online tools by NGOs and governments at every level.
