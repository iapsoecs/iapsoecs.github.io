**Research engineer in ocean modelling and data assimilation**

**Position overview:**

The international multidisciplinary research project “Sea Turtles for Ocean Research and Monitoring in the Indian Ocean” (STORM-IO) aims to improve our knowledge  of the spatial ecology of the five species of sea turtle living in the Indian Ocean, as well as our  ability to collect in-situ data in the ocean to better predict cyclonic activity in this part of the  world. The project is looking for a research engineer or postdoctoral fellow to work on the  assimilation of temperature and salinity data collected by sea turtles in the ocean model  NEMO. 

**Recruitment level:**

Ph. D. or Engineer degree 

**Candidate profile:**

Strong skills in applied mathematics and programming, with focus on  numerical modelling. Experience in ocean modelling and/or data assimilation preferred. 

**Work location:**

Inria (Grenoble, France) and University of La Réunion (Réunion Island). The  work will be carried out in close collaboration with researchers from MERCATOR-Ocean  International and the Comoros Meteorological Service. The person recruited should be based  in Grenoble for about a year, then in Saint-Denis de La Réunion for the next six months.  

**Mission:**

The selected candidate will work on numerical developments to improve the  performance of the NEMO ocean model in its global (NEMO-PSY4 operational model) and  regional (NEMO-Indian Ocean model) configurations. To this end, he/she will:  
- Develop or adapt a set of tools and procedures to objectively evaluate the representation of  the oceanic mixed layer simulated by the NEMO model under cyclonic conditions from  biologging data (temperature, salinity) collected by sea turtles within the framework of this  project; 
- Enable biologging observations to be taken into account in the Nemovar assimilation  system, and then assess the possibility of using sea turtle position data in a context of  coupling with the STAMM (Sea Turtle Active Movement Model), developed at Mercator Ocean. In this context, the cost/benefit ratio of 3DVar and 4DVar assimilation schemes on the  initial conditions of the ocean model and on cyclone forecasting will also be evaluated. 

**Type of contract:**

18-month full-time and fixed-term position. Extension possible subject to additional funding.

**Salary:**

Based on Réunion University’s salary scale. Net salary between 2250 and 2400 euros per month depending on experience including standard benefits (medical insurance,  retirement contributions). 

**Application:**

Send a Curriculum Vitae and references/letters of recommendation by email to  Arthur VIDARD (Arthur.Vidard@inria.fr) and Olivier BOUSQUET (olivier.bousquet@meteo.fr).
