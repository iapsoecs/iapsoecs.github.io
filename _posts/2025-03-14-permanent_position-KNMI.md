Hi everyone,

At KNMI we are looking for a new physical oceanographer. This is for a permanent position to work with the NEMO ocean model on different topics: the development of EC-EARTH, regional dynamic sea-level, ice-shelves/ocean interactions around Antarctica and the influence of the ocean on weather and climate change in the Netherlands.

If you are interested in those exciting topics and are not scared of getting deep into numerical ocean modelling please apply! The deadline for application is 27th of March.
