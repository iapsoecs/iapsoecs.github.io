the University of New South Wales, Sydney
Research Associate - Climate

More information:
Lifting the Lid on Marine Heatwaves

Job no: 514067
Work type: full time
Location: Sydney, NSW
Categories: Post Doctoral Research Associate

The Research Associate will contribute to an ARC-funded research
project on marine heatwaves. Marine heatwaves routinely cause major
ecosystem damage potentially affecting valuable industries. The aim of
this project is to extend our understanding to the workings of
temperature extremes hidden below the ocean surface and how other
concurrent ocean and terrestrial extremes interact with these marine
heatwaves. The project will generate significant new knowledge around
the mechanisms driving subsurface heatwaves and how they interact with
biogeochemical extremes.

This project has two primary aims: 1) To characterize different types
of subsurface MHWs, address how they are formed, quantify if they
persist beyond the life of their visible surface signature, and
examine how the subsurface ocean state prior to a MHW may provide a
means to better predict these extreme events, and 2) examine the
co-occurrence of compound temperature and biogeochemical extreme
events, how prevalent they are, and how they interact. The Research
Associate may work on either of both areas depending on their research
interests.
