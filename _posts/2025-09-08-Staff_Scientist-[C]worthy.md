Staff Scientist, Ocean Modeling
Boulder, CO[C]worthy – [C]worthy /Full Time /On-site

# About [C]Worthy
[C]Worthy is a Focused Research Organization operating in partnership with Convergent Research. We develop science-backed tools for Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) by adapting advanced oceanographic models to quantify carbon removal and assess ecosystem impacts with scientific credibility. These tools are delivered through our open-source software platform, C-Star, which is designed to ensure ease-of-use, standardization, auditability, and transparency — foundations for building high-integrity CDR markets. We collaborate with early commercial actors in the carbon removal market to support research, provide robust MRV solutions, and shape effective standards. We are also maintaining and building strong connections within the research community to ensure that our tools evolve alongside the best available science and technology.

# Position Description
We are seeking an experienced ocean modeler to lead the expansion of the C‑Star Ocean Network — a growing constellation of regional ocean domains that underpins robust MRV for ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) and direct ocean removal (DOR). The successful candidate will design and build high‑fidelity physical–biogeochemical model configurations, work hand‑in‑hand with early‑stage commercial partners and academic collaborators, and help build an inclusive, global community of practice around open‑source ocean modeling. This role sits at the intersection of cutting‑edge science and mission‑driven engineering: you will translate the latest oceanographic understanding into production‑grade tools that are transparent, auditable, and ready for regulatory scrutiny.

# Key Responsibilities

* Design, build, & maintain C-Star model configurations to support carbon quantification calculations and related applications in partnership with commercial and/or research partners.
* Perform and advise on scientific evaluation of C-Star model simulations.
* Contribute to the design and development of C-Star software infrastructure, including workflows related to model evaluation, observational comparisons, CDR quantification, and environmental and/or site suitability assessments.
* Provide technical support and guidance to C-Star users.
* Conduct original research on CDR quantification methodologies, publish methods and results in peer‑reviewed outlets, and represent [C]Worthy at scientific conferences and standards organizations.
* For sufficiently experienced candidates: Manage a team focused on deploying regional modeling configurations for commercial pilot projects and research sites.


# Qualifications

* Ph.D. in Oceanography, Atmospheric Science, Computer Science, or a related field.
* Demonstrated expertise building and running regional ocean models, including physical and biogeochemical components.
* Strong scientific programming skills.
* Experience working in Unix‑based HPC environments.
* Publication record or equivalent technical reports showcasing rigorous model evaluation.
* Ability to creatively combine highly technical research tools to solve complex problems.
* Excellent problem-solving and critical-thinking skills.
* Strong written and verbal communication skills.


# Preferred attributes

* Significant experience managing technical and scientific teams.
* Excellent interpersonal skills necessary to engage effectively with internal and external partners.
* Familiarity with numerical methods and algorithms used in oceanographic models.
* Demonstrated track record contributing to open-source software projects.
* Experience collecting and/or analyzing oceanographic observations.
* Experience working in interdisciplinary teams and translating scientific requirements into software specifications.


# Benefits

* Competitive salary: $120K to $190K depending on experience and position fit
* Health, vision, and dental insurance
* Wellness benefit
* Paid time off
* Flexible spending accounts for health care or childcare
* 401(k) retirement fund with matching employer contributions

# Location

[C]Worthy is based in Boulder, Colorado, and seeks to build a strong collaborative team. We prefer that employees spend significant time working together in person in our Boulder office.
