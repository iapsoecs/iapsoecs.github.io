We are seeking to recruit a Research Associate in Antarctic Climate Change to use historical climate observations and climate model simulations to explore the drivers of decadal climate variability in the Amundsen Sea region.

The position is part of a NERC funded project, DeCAdeS:  Drivers of Oceanic Change in the Amundsen Sea, led by Prof Adrian Jenkins at Northumbria University.  This project aims to better understand West Antarctic Ice Sheet loss by understanding the processes that drive decadal variability in the Amundsen Sea continental shelf waters and how these are influenced by large-scale climate variability and longer-term climate change, using novel in-situ measurements, satellite observations, numerical models and historical climate data.

This position is led by Dr Julie Jones of the University of Sheffield, and is jointly supervised by Dr Tom Bracegirdle of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge.

The closing date for applications is 7th September 2023.  

Salary:  £37,099 - £45,585 with potential to increase to £49,794 through sustained exceptional contribution.

This post is fixed-term for 30 months with an anticipated start date of 01 December 2023 and end date of 31 June 2026.

For informal enquiries about this job and the recruiting department, contact Dr Julie Jones (julie.jones@sheffield.ac.uk).
