We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to join our interdisciplinary project Tracing How Atlantic Water Impacts North Greenland (THAWING). This opportunity is ideal for a scientist with a strong physics background who is interested in applying principles of fluid dynamics and mathematical modelling to climate-related challenges in ocean-glacier dynamics.

The fellow will investigate ocean-glacier interactions using theoretical approaches, ocean-circulation modelling, and unique data from three icebreaker expeditions to North Greenland. A key research question is how Earth's rotation and fjord-glacier geometry limit the inflow of warmer Atlantic Water towards glaciers, thereby influencing subsurface melt on marine glaciers.

The dead line is May 5!
