The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) is an internationally renowned center for climate research located in Hamburg, Germany. The MPI-M provides a vibrant international and interdisciplinary environment for conducting scientific research as well as access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities. The institute is located in the heart of one of Europe’s most livable cities, and embedded in an environment known worldwide for its breadth of climate research.

 

The MPI-M is now opening a 2-year position for a

 

Postdoctoral Scientist (W099 | all genders)

 

in the EU H2020 project CONSTRAIN ( https://constrain-eu.org/ ) “Constraining uncertainty of multi-decadal climate projections” (GA 820829) in the area of ocean-atmosphere coupling and climate projections.

 

The particular task of MPI-M will be to work on the pattern effect and to investigate the mechanisms behind geographical and temporal changes in SST patterns. The work will be embedded in an international collaboration of 14 top European institutions, with many opportunities for meetings and exchange. Overall, CONSTRAIN focuses on characterizing decadal changes in radiative forcing, cloud feedbacks, circulation, and ocean variability to improve mid-century projections and constrain climate sensitivity.

 

**Your tasks**

·      Investigate the SST pattern effect in relation with the top-of-atmosphere radiation balance and radiative feedbacks in observations and model ensembles

·      Advance understanding of the spatial evolution of sea surface temperatures by developing methods of pattern detection, e.g. with machine learning

·      Disseminate the results through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences or through social media, video-blogs, etc.

 

**Our requirements**

·      A PhD in meteorology, oceanography, physics, environmental science or a related field

·      Experience in analyzing, evaluating, and visualizing large and complex datasets 

·      Experience in ocean dynamics, atmospheric dynamics, and ocean-atmosphere coupling

·      Ability to effectively communicate the results within the project and to outside colleagues as well as the ability to publish in international journals

 

**What we offer**

·         The position is available from December 2021 for 24 months

·         Payment will be in accordance with German public service positions (TVoeD E14), including extensive social security plans. The conditions of employment, including upgrades and duration, follow the rules of the Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Sciences and those of the German civil service.

·         The Max Planck Society strives for gender and diversity equality.

·         We welcome applications from all backgrounds.

·         Handicapped persons with comparable qualifications receive preferential status.

 

The selection criteria will value the qualifications, the experience and the ability of the candidates to fulfill the responsibilities as outlined above. A selection panel will be established for this purpose. In light of the institute and the funded projects commitment to support the career development of young scientists, preference in the selection will be given to candidates within a few years of their PhD.
