The Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics (AOPP) sub-department offers a number of DPhil (PhD) places every year for students to take part in the research work of the department.

Research focuses on the study of physical processes in the atmospheres, surfaces and oceans of the Earth and other planets, using experimental, theoretical and computational techniques. We have approximately 110 members, including 18 permanent academic staff, around 35 post-doctoral researchers and around 45 graduate students.
