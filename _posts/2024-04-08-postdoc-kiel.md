The Institute of Geosciences at the Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel is seeking to fill the position of a Research Assistant in the field of paleoclimate modeling with the aim of a habilitation (qualification position for young scientists).

The position is initially for a limited period of 3 years, starting as soon as possible. The position will be classified in the requirements in pay group 14 TV-L. The regular weekly working hours corresponds to the scope of a full-time position and is currently 38.7 hours. Associated with the position is a regular weekly teaching obligation of 4 LVS in accordance with the Teaching Obligation Ordinance.

The future post holder will perform numerical simulations using coupled climate carbon cycle models in order to investigate interactions between climate variability and biogeochemical cycles in the ocean. As part of this, innovative methods for comparing model and paleoclimate data will be developed. The advertised position includes participation in teaching in the geosciences degree programs (BSc, MSc; focus on paleoclimate modeling) with a teaching obligation of 4 semester hours per week. Furthermore, the future post holder will be given sufficient opportunity to carry out his/her own scientific work. A correspondingly targeted research activity in the field of paleoclimate modeling is expected.

We are looking for a highly motivated scientist with proven expertise and a doctorate in geosciences, oceanography, meteorology or a related field (e.g. physics, mathematics, biology). Experience in the modeling of (paleo) climate and/or marine nutrient cycles and excellent programming skills are required. Due to the international working environment, very good communication skills in English, corresponding to language level C1, are required. The person should be able to work independently and as part of a dynamic team.
