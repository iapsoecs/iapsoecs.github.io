Applications are invited for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Victoria (https://www.uvic.ca/) or the University of British Columbia (https://www.ubc.ca/) to conduct glider-centred process studies of continental shelf dynamics off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. The project is in partnership with the Canadian-Pacific Robotic Ocean Observing Facility (https://cproof.uvic.ca/) and the Hakai Institute (https://hakai.org/). As part of Pacific Rim Ocean Data Mobilization and Technology (PRODIGY, https://eoas-prodigy-2021.sites.olt.ubc.ca/), the fellow will also contribute to the research, teaching, mentoring, and partner engagement initiatives of the PRODIGY training program, delivering advanced graduate and postgraduate training in ocean observation, prediction and knowledge mobilization.

Past experience working with ocean gliders and/or ocean glider datasets is highly desirable. There is an exciting opportunity to employ glider-mounted turbulent microstructure instrumentation and engage with C-PROOF and PRODIGY partner Rockland Scientific (https://rocklandscientific.com/); thus experience and/or interest in microstructure turbulence observations is an asset.

For full details about the position, its requirements and additional details please see:

To apply, submit the following by email to prodigy@eoas.ubc.ca : 

1) a cover letter, outlining special areas of research interest, relevant teaching and research experience, and fit with the position as described at the link above; 
2) a current CV; 
3) the names of at least two references; and 
4) sample research publications. 
 
Review of applications will begin immediately, and the position will remain open until filled, with a preferred start date of Sept. 1, 2023 or earlier.

Please direct questions to Drs. Jody Klymak and Stephanie Waterman (jklymak@uvic.ca, swaterman@eoas.ubc.ca).
