As part of the French program “Make our Planet Great Again” (MOGPA), we are seeking for an outstanding and highly motivated postdoctoral researcher to apply to a postdoctoral funding opportunity on Arctic physical-biogeochemical modeling. Experience in using MITgcm-Darwin would be welcome.

The project will be on land-ocean connectivity at high spatial resolution on the Mackenzie shelf (Beaufort Sea, Western Arctic).

The postdoctoral fellow will be hosted at the La Rochelle Université (France) and will benefit from tight interactions with researchers from NASA JPL Caltech and from the French CNRS/U Laval Takuvik team (Canada). The fellow will also benefit from the European H2020 Nunataryuk Arctic project (<https://nunataryuk.org>).

Applicants for this position should have a PhD in ocean-biogeochemical modeling or a related field. The postdoctoral candidate is expected to have strong computational skills, a good publication record, a high level of independence, curiosity and creativity, and a strong interest in working in an international research team.

This is a 1-year full-time position. The project is expected to begin in January 2021.
