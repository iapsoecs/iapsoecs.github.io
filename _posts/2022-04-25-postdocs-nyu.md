We are looking for two postdocs or research associates to join our team at NYU, led by Prof Laure Zanna, and work at the interface between climate science and machine learning.

The successful applicants will perform research as part of the new multi-institution international project, M²LInES, supported by Schmidt Futures, which aims to further our understanding of climate processes and to reduce climate model biases at the air-sea/ice interface, using scientific machine learning. They will join the M²LInES NYU team, currently composed of professors Joan Bruna, Carlos Fernandez-Granda and Laure Zanna, as well as multiple postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students.

The main topic of research is to develop machine-learned models for ocean processes from outputs of high-resolution climate simulations and data-assimilation products. The scientific goal is to deepen our understanding of ocean mesoscale momentum, buoyancy and energy transport, in particular at the air-sea interface and to develop new mesoscale parameterizations for use in existing global climate models. For examples of our work in this area, see https://tinyurl.com/6wcjxxfe;   https://tinyurl.com/yckwscu4;  https://tinyurl.com/3cu4c4pd.

The positions, available immediately, will be for one year initially, with the possibility of renewal for up to 3 years, based on performance and availability of funding.
