2-year Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Climate and Global Dynamics Lab at NCAR

Application deadline: November 17th 2023 

We are looking for a postdoctoral fellow to join our NOAA CVP sponsored pre-field campaign project on advancing our understanding of air-sea coupling and ocean processes in the tropical Pacific. The fellow will be part of a team that develops the upcoming PUMACAT (Pacific Upwelling and Mixing Act to Couple Atmosphere to Thermocline) campaign investigating dynamics and scale-interactions contributing to sea surface temperature variability in the tropical Pacific. There is room for exploration of ocean upwelling and mixing processes, as well as air-sea coupling, we are looking forward to reading about ideas in the research interest statement.

You can find out more about the position and how to apply here, and a little more information about the larger project of designing the field campaigns here.

For more information please contact the PI Dr. Anna-Lena Deppenmeier (deppenme@ucar.edu).
