Position Description:

The Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies
(CICOES) has an outstanding opportunity for a postdoctoral scholar to
conduct research in Arctic marine chemistry and ocean biogeochemical
modeling. The position will be based at the NOAA Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory (PMEL), and will be mentored by scientists from
both CICOES and NOAA PMEL. The postdoctoral scholar will conduct
cutting-edge research using newly developed observational technology to
skill test regional biogeochemical model output for the Bering Sea
from both a hindcast simulation (1970-present) as well as 4-5 month
seasonal forecasts. This work will be in support of ocean acidification
products developed to assist NOAA Fisheries management. This project also
intersects with marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) research conducted at
NOAA PMEL due to the necessity of developing validated models to provide
Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) for proposed CDR techniques.
This postdoc position is funded for 1 year with a possible extension for 1
additional year, by a research project led by PI Darren Pilcher and Dr.
Jessica Cross, along with collaborators Dr. Brendan Carter and Dr. Wei
Cheng.


Major duties include:
? Utilize observational data from a combination of ship-based sampling,
moorings, and
autonomous instruments to skill test model output on multiple timeframes.
? Assist in the development of model products used to support NOAA
Fisheries management.
? Lead and contribute to publications in peer-reviewed journals, presenting
at scientific
conferences, participating in proposal writings.
? Document progress on tasks and communicate progress regularly with other
team members and leadership.

The impact of CICOES?s environmental research is felt by communities all
over the world, and a broad variety of perspectives and life experiences is
essential to the success of this research. We encourage candidates from
groups historically and currently underrepresented in this field to apply.

Required qualifications:
-A PhD in oceanography, marine science, or a closely related field.
-A demonstrated ability to work with large scientific datasets.
-A demonstrated ability to clearly communicate complicated ideas through
presentations and peer reviewed scientific manuscripts.
-Expert knowledge in the marine carbonate system.
-A strong background in at least one analytical coding language (Matlab,
Python, R, etc.).

Desired Qualifications:
- Experience working with computational biogeochemical model output.
- Demonstrated strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and
effective verbal and written
communication skills.
- Ability to work independently and as part of a team, interacting
cooperatively with people from
diverse backgrounds and academic levels.
- Interest in Arctic marine chemistry, climate change science, and human
impacts of changing oceans,
in particular ocean acidification.
