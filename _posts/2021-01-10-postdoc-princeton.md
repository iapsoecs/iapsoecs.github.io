**Research Scientist in Mesoscale Eddy Parameterization**

The Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program, in association with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), seeks a postdoctoral or more senior researcher to work in the area of mesoscale eddy parameterization.

This work is a component of a high profile Climate Process Team (CPT) on Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy involving multiple institutions including New York University (NYU), Woods Hole Oceanographic Inst., University of Colorado, Boulder, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, among others. The role of the Princeton team is to i) implement existing parameterizations in a numerical ocean circulation model (MOM6), ii) evaluate parameterizations in both an idealized ocean and later a global climate model, iii) help develop, implement, and assess, new parameterizations created at the partner institutions. The work will be very collaborative and involve some travel for project workshops, frequent virtual meetings, and regular travel between Princeton and NYU to coordinate with the lead PI, Laure Zanna, and her team. Information about the broader project and related positions can be found at https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/.

The ideal candidate has a strong background in one or more areas among dynamical oceanography, dynamical meteorology, applied mathematics, or numerical methods. Experience with scientific software development will be advantageous in this research.

Candidates must have a Ph.D. in either applied oceanography, meteorology, mathematics, physics, or a related field. Initial appointment is for one year with the possibility of renewal subject to satisfactory performance and available funding.

Complete applications, including a CV with a list of publications, a statement of research interests (no more than 2 pages including references), and contact information of 3 references should be submitted by February 15, 2021, 11:59 p.m. EST for full consideration. Princeton is interested in candidates who, through their research, will contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community. Applicants should apply online to https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/18962.

For more information about the research project and application process, please contact Alistair Adcroft (aadcroft@princeton.edu), Stephen Griffies (stephen.griffies@noaa.gov), Robert Hallberg (robert.hallberg@noaa.gov).
