Applications are invited for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship (PDF) to
study the dynamics of the continental shelf off the coast of British
Columbia Canada using a diverse collection of in situ ocean observations
including ocean glider, mooring and ship-based data.

**Background:**

Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) is a large semi-enclosed body of water off the
central coast of British Columbia Canada north of Vancouver Island. The
region is a vital commercial and subsistence fishing ground, and hosts many
of western Canada?s Marine Protected Areas. Unlike much of continental
shelf of British Columbia, the shelf here is very wide, relatively shallow,
and incised by a large number of canyons with egress to the open ocean.
Similar to much of the west coast of the Americas, wind-driven upwelling
plays a dominant role in the regional dynamics. However, QCS has very
strong freshwater forcing from the surrounding mountain ranges and vigorous
mixing, implying that lateral buoyancy-driven (estuarine-like) circulation
is also important in driving cross-shelf transports.  On the landward side,
QCS is surrounded by fjords that are home to commercially-important salmon
populations. Some of these fjords are deep with annual deep-water renewal;
an important implication is that fjord waters periodically go
hypoxic. Better understanding of QCS shelf circulation will allow us to
better understand how these productive fjords renew, and improve our
ability to predict how they will be impacted by future change.



**Project Goals:** 

The project aims to address the following research
questions.
   1. What are the dominant transport pathways in Queen Charlotte Sound?
   2. How do these pathways connect the open ocean to British Columbia?s
   central coast? What are the dynamical processes involved in these
   connections?
   3. How do these pathways and processes impact properties that are
   important for the marine ecosystem (e.g. water temperature, oxygen, pH, and
   primary production)?

**Project Team:**

The fellow will collaborate closely with a working group
that includes scientists from the Hakai Institute, the University of
British Columbia, the University of Victoria and the Institute of Ocean
Sciences, a scientific facility of Fisheries and Oceans Canada.  Further,
the fellow will join the Canadian-Pacific Robotic Ocean Observing Facility
(C-PROOF) team. The project is supervised by Dr. Stephanie Waterman
(University of British Columbia), Dr. Jennifer Jackson (Hakai Institute),
Dr. Jody Klymak (University of Victoria), Dr. Tetjana Ross (Institute of
Ocean Sciences) and Dr. Charles Hannah (Institute of Ocean Sciences).


**Position Responsibilities:**

The fellow will be responsible for the
following tasks within the context of the overall project as described
above.
   1.  to work with the project team on processing, analyzing and
   interpreting existing observational data;
   2. to participate in the continued collection of *in situ* observational
   data in the region;
   3. to work with the regional modelling community on comparing
   observations and model simulations to better understand the fidelity of the
   models in capturing coastal processes
   4. to write high-impact manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed
   journals.

**Requirements:**

   - a PhD in physical oceanography
   - experience working with observational datasets, as evidenced by the
   candidate?s publication record
   - willingness to work collaboratively with a group of scientists with
   diverse expertise and experiences in oceanography
   - capacity to lead projects with collaborators, excellent communication
   skills, and demonstrated ability to finish projects on time

**Additional Details:**

The Hakai Institute is a research organization based
in British Columbia with substantial oceanographic observations collected
by experts in physical, chemical and biological data. The PDF will have the
opportunity to visit Hakai field stations occasionally, though this project
is primarily focused on the analysis and synthesis of data that have
already been collected. The position will be officially based at the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver Canada, though the successful
candidate can choose to be based in Vancouver, Victoria, or Sidney.

This is a limited term, two-year PDF position paid at a rate of $55,000 CAD
per year plus Mandatory Employment Related Benefits. There is an
opportunity for renewal given satisfactory performance and funding
availability. A research budget is also available. We seek a candidate who
has completed a PhD within the last five years (special allowances will be
made for career interruptions and personal circumstances) and who shows
evidence of strong quantitative skills and an understanding of coastal
oceanography.

To apply, please send a cover letter, CV and two research publications to
Dr. Stephanie Waterman by email (*swaterman@eoas.ubc.ca*). Your cover letter should address your motivation
to excel in this project, and the skills and experience you can bring to
the work. Review of applications will begin on *February 1 2021.* Start
date is negotiable with a preferred start of spring or summer 2021.
