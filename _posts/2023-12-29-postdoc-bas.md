Applications are invited for a 47-month postdoctoral position on climate modelling at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), Cambridge, UK.

 

We are looking for a talented and self-motivated scientist to work on the ExtAnt â€“ Drivers and Impacts of EXTreme Weather Events in ANTarctica project, which will provide the first comprehensive assessment of present day and future high impact extreme weather events in Antarctica, and associated risks. This research will mainly focus on developing statistical emulators for regional climate models of Antarctica and use them to downscale 21st century climate change projections from a subset of global climate models used in large-ensemble datasets and assess how high impact extreme events will change in the future, with a particular focus on the impacts on ice shelves. This role will require a strong understanding of statistics and experience analysing and visualising climate model and/or observational datasets, as well as a good understanding of climate/meteorology.

The closing date for applications is 21 January 2024
