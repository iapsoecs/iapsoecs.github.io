Postdoctoral Research Scientist, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University

The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University located in Palisades, New York, invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Scientist position in the Ocean Carbon Group.

The position will focus on quantifying and reducing uncertainty in extrapolations of sparse surface ocean pCO2 observations to global coverage. The work will involve (1) evaluation of existing extrapolations and observing strategies within an existing testbed based in Large Ensemble climate models, (2) maturing extrapolation techniques to more explicitly include uncertainty quantification, and (3) assessing implications for scientific understanding of the mechanisms of spatial and temporal variability in the ocean carbon sink. Prior experience with oceanography, carbon cycle science, and data science methods is strongly preferred.

The candidate will be expected to build strong links with collaborators in the Department of Statistics, and at NOAA research laboratories. They will also be a full member of the new community of climate data scientists organized around a new center, Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (LEAP, https://leap.columbia.edu), a new Science and Technology Center funded by NSF.

Candidates should have completed or be nearing completion of a PhD in ocean and climate science, or a closely related field. Excellent communication, interpersonal and organizational skills and ability to use independent judgment required. Evidence of the ability to conduct and publish high quality research is required.

Proposed start date is April 1, 2022, with some flexibility. Appointments will be for 1-year, with continuation pending funding and progress.

The search will remain open for at least 30 days after the ad appears and will continue until the position is filled.
