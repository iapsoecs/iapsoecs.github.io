# Job Description

Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) invites applications for a Postdoctoral Investigator (PDI) to conduct research into the coupled physical, biogeochemical, and food web dynamics of the Northwest Atlantic Ecosystem. The successful candidate will be supervised by Dr. Gregory Britten (WHOI) and co-supervised by Drs. Ke Chen (WHOI), Weifeng (Gordon) Zhang (WHOI), Rubao Ji (WHOI), and Stephanie Dutkiewicz (MIT). Initial work will focus on developing coupled planktonic food web models for the United States Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (link), containing the National Science Foundation Northeast Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research Site (link). Contingent on progress, continued funding beyond the first year will be available to:

* Apply models to predict the impacts of offshore wind development on the ocean circulation, nutrient supply, and biological productivity of the US Northeast Shelf
* Extend models to conduct simulations and ecological data assimilation to understand the role of planktonic and microbial food web structure in governing carbon fluxes to the deep sea 

WHOI is situated in the village of Woods Hole, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, approximately 1.5 hours driving south of Boston. WHOI has approximately 1200 full-time employees and students engaged in oceanographic research and education. WHOI is co-located in Woods Hole with the University of Chicago Marine Biological Laboratory, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, USGS Coastal and Marine Science Center, and Woodwell Climate Research Center, driving a vibrant marine research community. 

WHOI has a top-ranked postdoctoral program (link) that supports a dynamic postdoctoral community with formal mentoring and career guidance programs. The PDI will have opportunities to participate in educational and outreach activities associated with the project, including collaborations with graduate students of the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography (link) which is a top-ranked oceanography PhD program co-taught with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within the greater Boston area.

Qualified applicants should submit a combined cover letter and research statement (maximum two pages), CV, up to three relevant publications, and names/contact information for at least three professional references. Please apply online at https://url-here. WHOI is committed to scientific excellence and diversity, and we strongly encourage applications from candidates who will contribute to a culturally diverse and inclusive environment. The review of applications will begin January 1 and will continue until the position is filled. Please contact Dr. Gregory Britten (gregory.britten@whoi.edu) with any questions regarding the position. Please apply at careers@whoi.edu

 

# Additional Job Description

Additional Job Description

The PDI will be responsible for:

* developing research questions and designing data analysis to address research questions
* developing models and computer code to simulate plankton population and biogeochemical dynamics
* communicating with and seeking feedback on research progress with team members
* communicating results in conference proceedings and peer-reviewed publications

 

# Required Experience & Education 

The ideal candidate will have strong numerical modeling experience and quantitative skills, including a PhD in oceanography, ecology, earth science, applied mathematics, physics, or related discipline.  A general understanding of ecological modelling, community ecology, and the interactions between physical and biogeochemical/ecological processes is desirable. Experience with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS; link) and/or the Darwin plankton-biogeochemistry model is preferred but not required. The PDI will collaborate with an interdisciplinary team of experts via institution-wide initiatives at WHOI. Strong oral and written communication skills are required as demonstrated through peer-reviewed scientific publications and presentations. This is a full-time position with full benefits (link).

 

# Physical Requirements 

 Remote work is a possibility depending on circumstances.

 

# Travel 

The postdoc may be asked to travel to workshops and conference proceedings to disseminate results. Accommodation for personal circumstances not permitting travel is possible.

 

# Work Authorization/Security Clearance

Authorization to work in the US will be required if not already obtained.
