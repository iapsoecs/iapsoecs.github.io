Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) has an exciting opportunity for a senior scientist to join our modeling team.

 

We are looking for an experienced senior scientist motivated to develop a leading role within our existing team, who will focus on developing strategies, systems, and applications of data assimilation with coupled biogeochemical-hydrodynamic models in a variety of marine systems across the globe. In this role, the successful candidate will be an integral part of the NCEO (National Centre for Earth Observation) in the UK, providing a focal point for EO data assimilation into biogeochemical models, particularly with respect to capturing marine carbon behaviour and flux intensities. The candidate will be able to influence the national direction of cross-disciplinary use of modeling techniques through activities in the National Partnership for Ocean Prediction, which include collaborations with other institutes, leading Universities, and the UK Met Office.
