## Postdoctoral Researcher (Air-Sea Modeling) at SOEST, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa

We are seeking a highly motivated and independent scientist for a postdoctoral researcher position in the Department of Oceanography at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. The successful candidate will work under the supervision of Dr. Hyodae Seo and Dr. César Sauvage on projects focused on coupled boundary layer processes, surface waves, and offshore wind energy over the Mid-Atlantic Bight. The candidate should have strong background in numerical modeling and quantitative analysis skills. Prior experience in surface wave modeling and coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling is preferred. Experience with observational analyses of the upper ocean physics, air-sea fluxes, and/or atmospheric boundary layer processes is also desirable. 

The initial appoint is 1 year, with the continuation of employment for a second year contingent upon program/operational needs, satisfactory performance, availability of funds, and compliance with Federal/State laws.

Applicants must submit their application forms online (ID# 225013)
