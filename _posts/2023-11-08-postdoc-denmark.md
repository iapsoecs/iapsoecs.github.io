As part of a new research project, we are seeking applicants for a 2-year Postdoc in marine ecology at the Department of Ecoscience, Aarhus University, Denmark. We offer an exciting opportunity to join a new research project funded by the Danish Villum Foundation. The project will investigate links between seabird migration and the global distribution of seamounts. Some evidence suggests that long-ranging seabirds concentrate their foraging around open ocean seamounts, which are often described as oceanic oases of productivity and biodiversity. However, no systematic assessment of connections between seamounts and seabirds exists to date. Results of this project will shed light on the importance of oceanic seamounts for the global distribution and diversity of seabirds and will provide important information for identifying future candidate Marine Protected Areas.
