24-month postdoctoral position on understanding the risk of tipping point of the North Atlantic
subpolar gyre at University of Bordeaux

A Postdoctoral position is available at University of Bordeaux to work within the UK ARIA project
named SORTED led by the National Oceanographic Center (NOC) in Southampton. This proposed
position aims at better understanding and anticipating the risk of a tipping point of the North Atlantic
subpolar gyre in the near future.

The North Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG) plays a key role in global ocean circulation through
the process of convection, resulting in the transfer of heat and carbon to the deep ocean. However,
some CMIP6 climate models project a collapse of this convection before 2100, causing sudden
cooling and changes in the mixed layer. It is linked to the lightening of the surface waters of the
North Atlantic, caused by warming, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, the increase in
atmospheric precipitation, which are increasing stratification of the ocean. However, the exact
mechanisms leading to such a tipping point remain debated. To better understand these processes
and anticipate possible early warning signals, an in-depth analysis of heat, volume and salinity
budgets in CMIP6 models is required as well as the quantification of water mass transformation in
the SPG and its evolution through time. The work proposed to the postdoctoral fellow is to identify
the processes leading to the critical stratification that prevents convection, by examining the ocean's
spatial density, temperature and salinity budgets. The aim is to isolate the factors responsible for the
formation of dense water and to assess their role in the collapse of the SPG. The study will integrate
air-sea fluxes, horizontal and vertical advection and climate feedbacks specific to the SPG. A
comparison with observations and high-resolution experiments will make it possible to test the
representation of these processes in CMIP6 models.

The postdoctoral fellow will therefore determine the respective roles played by each
component of the upper ocean budget in the development of a critical stratification before the SPG
collapse. The postdoctoral fellow will additionally assess the links between these processes and
changes in large-scale dynamics, such as atmospheric water vapour (moisture) transport, remote
anomalies of heat and salinity transported by North Atlantic drift as well as internal feedback specific
to the SPG. By comparing the budget analysis in CMIP6 models and observations notably provided by
our partner the NOC, the postdoctoral fellow will strengthen our understanding of the drivers of
deep convection over the SPG and of their sensitivity to different emission scenarios, which will be
further tested through dedicated experiments in higher resolution models. Finally, the work will
focus on the quantification of the positive salt advection feedback from the SPG system using a
methodology that evaluates the origin of density changes in convection sites for the AMOC, adapted
here for the SPG system. Such an approach is crucial in our understanding of the interconnected
dynamics at play in different climate models. From the comparison with observations, we will be able
to evaluate the proximity of the real system to a tipping point and develop an early warning system
based on observation.

This project is being carried out at the EPOC laboratory at the University of Bordeaux, under
the supervision of Didier Swingedouw and in collaboration with the NOC in Southampton. The EPOC
laboratory is just two hours by train from Paris where some collaborations could be built with IPSL
laboratories. Some short stays in Southampton could be also envisaged to strengthen interactions
within the project.

Thus, we are searching for an expert in physical oceanography and climate dynamics profile.
The position is offered for 24 months, potentially renewable once. Payment will be in accordance
with French public service salaries (between 2500 and 4000 Euros before taxes, depending on
experience). The starting date is as soon as possible. Application will close the 18th of July 2025.
The postdoctoral fellowship will be primarily supervised by Didier Swingedouw. Applications
will be accepted by e-mail only. They should comprise: a CV with scientific experience, a letter of
motivation with an availability date, and some referee name(s). Applications and queries should be
sent to the following e-mail addresses: didier.swingedouw@u-bordeaux.fr
