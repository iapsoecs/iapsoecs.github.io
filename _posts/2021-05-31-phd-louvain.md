Four-year PhD position on the predictability of extremes of Arctic sea ice reduction with rare event simulation methods available at the Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium.


The Georges Lemaître Centre for Earth and Climate Research (www.uclouvain.be/teclim) of the Université Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, is looking for a PhD student for 4 years to work on the predictability of extreme Arctic sea ice reduction using rare event simulation methods.


Arctic sea ice is decreasing since several decades due to climate change. However, internal variability can determine extreme deviations from the already decreasing trend, such as observed in 2007 and 2012. The goal of the project is to improve our understanding of the processes leading to such events, in order to improve their predictability and quantify their risk of occurrence under different climate change scenarios.


In this PhD project we will study extremes of Arctic sea ice reduction applying rare event algorithms to climate models of different complexity. Rare event algorithms are computational techniques recently introduced to climate science that allow to guide a numerical model to oversample rare dynamical trajectories leading to extreme events of interest. This will allow to increase by orders of magnitude the number of extreme sea ice reduction events available in the simulations, and to perform robust statistical and dynamical studies of the processes and conditions responsible for these events. Please see the attachement for more details on the project.


The PhD position is for 4 years, starting on October 1st, 2021, with a net monthly salary of about 2064 EUR and full coverage in terms of medical and social insurances. The student will be supervised by Profs Francesco Ragone and François Massonnet.


We are looking for candidates with a Master degree in physics, atmospheric/oceanographic sciences, mathematics or engineering. Candidates should have robust mathematical and statistical skills, as well as an interest in working with numerical climate models and innovative computational methods.


Applicants should send (i) a statement of interest, (ii) a complete CV and (iii) the names and contacts of two references to Prof Francesco Ragone (francesco.ragone@uclouvain.be). The deadline for the submission of the applications is June 13th, 2021.
