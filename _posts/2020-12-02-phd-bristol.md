**New NERC GW4+ PhD project at Bristol**

The project will be based at the University of Bristol and the Plymouth
Marine Laboratory (PML) to work with Dr Fanny Monteiro, Dr Oliver Andrews
and Dr Andy Rees. The project will combine ocean modelling and laboratory
work and also offers opportunities to visit our collaborator in California
and participate in ocean cruises to collect data.

Deadline: Friday 8th January 2021

Project details:
N2O is a major atmospheric greenhouse gas with the ocean being one of the
most significant sources. The project aims to evaluate the impacts of
climate change on the sources of ocean N2O. The student will combine ocean
modelling with expertise at the University of Bristol, and laboratory
analysis with expertise at PML.
