We are looking for a motivated PhD candidate to work on the project FUTURISKS, on "Coastal flooding in overseas reef and lagoon systems: numerical modeling and in-situ measurements of water levels". This thesis is co-funded by the FUTURISKS Ocean and Climate PPR (https://futurisks.recherche.univ-lr.fr/en/projet-en/) and Shom.

### Thesis Supervisors

- Frédéric Bouchette, Professor at Université de Montpellier CNRS - Centre national de la recherche scientifique
- Héloïse Michaud, Research Scientist at Shom Toulouse
- Yann Krien, Associate Professor at LEGOS, Université Paul Sabatier Toulouse III CNRS - Centre national de la recherche scientifique


###  Logistics

- Based at Géosciences Montpellier and the Shom antenna in Toulouse, South of France
- Regular stays at other supervision sites (LEGOS, Toulouse) and occasionally with other FUTURISKS team members
- Preferentially located in Toulouse, France after the first year
- Participation in official FUTURISKS meetings and overseas field campaigns

### Research Topic

The thesis aims to characterize and quantify the water level dynamics in reef-lagoon systems and its representation in numerical models. The goal is to identify, quantify and better describe the fundamental hydrodynamic mechanisms impacting the water level at the coast and be able to introduce them into a numerical model to study the event-driven or long-term dynamics of marine submersion in reef-lagoon systems.

The thesis is organized around two main objectives:
1. Improving knowledge and quantification of the processes controlling wave spectrum transformations and hydrodynamics to study the impact on total water level at the coast in complex morphological contexts.
2. Improving the representativeness of these processes in phase-resolved wave models in these complex environments.
