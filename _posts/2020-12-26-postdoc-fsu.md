Responsibilities

The Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS) at the Florida State University, invites applications for a 1-year Postdoctoral Fellow, with a possibility for renewal for one more year upon satisfactory progress and availability of funds. The Fellow will be involved in further developing and conducting regional coupled ocean-atmosphere climate modeling in the tropics, starting in February 2021.

The main role of the postdoc will be to work as a coupled ocean-atmosphere modeler using the Regional Spectral Model-Regional Ocean Model System (RSM-ROMS). Key tasks for the successful candidate will include undertaking training in the use of RSM-ROMS, and then working to implement changes in the physics of the atmospheric component and or in the oceanic component of the model to evaluate its impact on the simulation of extreme weather events, intraseasonal variations and longer-term climate simulations in the tropics. Additionally, the post-doc will have the opportunity to work and direct with select graduate and undergraduate students working on related research projects with the PI.

Qualifications

- Ph. D. or an equivalent degree in Atmospheric Sciences/Meteorology/Climate Science or related field or must have submitted his/her doctoral theses for assessment prior to joining.

- Ability to work comfortably in the Unix/Linux environment with experience in statistical analysis of climate data, shell scripting, and experience with Python/Matlab/GrADS or similar analysis software.

- Experience in climate modeling (especially with WRF and or ROMS) and dealing with complex Fortran codes is desirable.

- Strong verbal and writing communication skills.

The applicant must be motivated, have the ability to work independently, and be willing to cooperate with peers and students in the team.
