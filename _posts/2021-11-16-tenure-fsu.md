The Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science (EOAS) at the Florida State University (FSU) invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor position in the area of Physical Oceanography.  The ideal candidate should have a solid background in addressing fundamental research questions about the functioning of the ocean from regional to climate settings.  Applications from those skilled in observational analyses, measurements, modeling, theory and/or interdisciplinary investigations will be particularly welcomed.  

Appointees are expected to develop and maintain a vigorous externally funded research program in their specialty area of interest and to teach courses and contribute to both the undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the department.

FSU also hosts a local High Performance Computing Center.  Aside from the faculty within EOAS, the successful candidate can expect collaborations with the Center for Ocean-Atmosphere Prediction Studies, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute, the Marine Lab, Mathematics and Scientific Computing.
