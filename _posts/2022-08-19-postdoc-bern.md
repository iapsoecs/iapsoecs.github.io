The Division of Climate and Environmental Physics, Physics Institute, at the University of Bern
in Switzerland, opens a position for a postdoc in late Pleistocene climate modelling.

Research is carried out in the framework of the groups of Climate and Environmental Physics
and the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research. The postdoc will use the Bern3D
model, a climate model of intermediate complexity, that consists of a 3-dimensional ocean, an
energy-moisture balance model of the atmosphere, many ocean tracers, and a prognostic
land-ocean carbon cycle. The cost-effective model permits glacial-interglacial simulations and
is suitable for the investigation of dynamics of tipping points associated with abrupt changes in
the ocean's overturning circulation. The work will focus on the Mid-Pleistocene Transition
(MPT) about 1 million years ago when the ice age cyclicity slowed down by about a factor of
2.5. You will explore the stability of warm, intermediate, and cold climate states to understand
the dynamics before and after the MPT. Collaboration with paleoceanographers and model
development, e.g., implementing new tracers, is a possibility.

We are looking for a highly motivated scientist who strives for original scientific achievements
obtained in team work. You have a degree in Physics, Geosciences, Meteorology, Oceanography, or similar, and experience in Pleistocene paleoclimate research. 
Candidates who have developed or used climate models have an advantage. Expected are advanced operating and
programming skills in one of the following: Unix, Fortran, C++, Phyton, R. Demonstrated
leadership in writing (peer-reviewed scientific publications) and excellent communication skills
in English, as well as the commitment to collaborate within an interdisciplinary framework are
essential, in particular with fellow scientists at Climate and Environmental Physics who use the
Bern3D coupled climate model.

The employment is for 2 years with a possible extension. The salary is according to the
postdoctoral scale of the University of Bern and depends on experience. A small contribution to
teaching in the Physics curriculum is expected.

Application:

Your application is in one pdf-file and consists of a motivation letter, CV, a link to a PDF file of
your PhD thesis, MSc and PhD certificates including evaluations, and the contact details of
three referees. The position is open now until a suitable candidate is found. Please upload
