The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) invites applications for a Postdoctoral Investigator
to study drivers and impacts of Arctic climate variability and change with a team of scientists from
WHOI (Young-Oh Kwon and Claude Frankignoul) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR; Gokhan Danabasoglu and Steve Yeager). The project aims to better understand, quantify,
and constrain model biases and uncertainties associated with Arctic climate and its interactions
with lower latitudes, based on an improved understanding of the role of poleward heat and
freshwater/moisture transports in the ocean and atmosphere. This is a regular, full-time position,
eligible for full benefits. The appointment will be for 18 months. Start date is flexible with
a preference to be prior to June 1, 2022. Initial consideration will be given to applications
received before January 15, 2022, but the position will remain open until it is filled.
