We seek a talented post-doctoral scientist to carry out research to better understand the predictability of subpolar North Atlantic tipping points. Full time, fixed term position up to 30 Months, and is available to start immediately.

Tipping points, where the climate system undergoes rapid and abrupt changes, or changes that are irreversible on societal timescales, are one of the most uncertain and potentially impactful consequences of a warming climate. The North Atlantic subpolar gyre and the Greenland Icesheet are two such suspected tipping points with the potential to drastically change European weather. However, there is a large uncertainty in the processes that are leading to such tipping points and it is currently unknown how predictable these events could be.

To make progress, you will use statistical and physical models to improve our understanding of the predictability of subpolar North Atlantic tipping points and identify the regions and variables that enable successful predictions. Additionally, you will work to understand the physical process that are shaping subpolar tipping points and their representation within earth system models.

## You will have:

* A PhD (or shortly expect to receive) or equivalent experience in mathematical or physical science
* Strong scientific analytical ability, and self-motivation
* Experience of analysing output from climate models or similar datasets
* Good communication skills
* The disposition to collaborate effectively with both internal and external project members

The post will be based in the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, within the Department of Meteorology, and is part of the PROMOTE (Progressing Earth System Modelling for Tipping Point Early Warning Systems) project, funded under the Forecasting Tipping Points (FTP) programme of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA).Please note that candidates are required to be based in Reading for the entire duration of the contract.

## Application guidance:

Candidates should include a cover letter indicating their interest in the role and motivation for applying.
