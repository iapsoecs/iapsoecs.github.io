We are looking for a postdoc to work on high resolution ocean modelling around the Antarctic margins. The position will be based at the Australian National University in Canberra and work collaboratively within the multi-institute Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science. Funding is available for 3 years.

The position aims to better understand the oceanic processes which control the delivery of heat to Antarcticaâ€™s continental shelf and adjacent ice shelves, using high resolution ocean-sea ice modelling. Key science questions include 1) understanding projected ocean feedbacks to basal melt, including changes in polynya dynamics, ice shelf cavity circulation and cross-slope heat exchange, 2) quantifying the sensitivity of ocean heat transport to changes in local and remote forcing (e.g. winds, upstream freshwater fluxes and the open ocean heat reservoir), and 3) investigating mechanisms governing warm intrusions onto the shelf (e.g. eddies, coastal-trapped waves, bottom flows, tides). Depending on the postdoc's interests, the position may also include contributing to the development of regional Antarctic high resolution ocean-sea ice models (MOM6 based) for better resolving processes on the Antarctic continental shelf and slope.

Applications close 26th July, and full details are available here.

Please get in touch (adele.morrison@anu.edu.au) if you have any questions about the position.
