The Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (CIMAR) is currently recruiting for a permanent Researcher position to work with NOAA’s CoastWatch/OceanWatch Program (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw/index.html) who will be based at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu, HI and work closely with the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center’s Ecosystem Sciences Division.  The Researcher will manage the OceanWatch satellite remote sensing datasets and data platforms (website, THREDDS, ERDDAP) and will also have the opportunity to conduct original research for the creation of new and value-added oceanographic and climate products derived from satellite remotely sensed data and from atmosphere-ocean general circulation models.  Developing, managing, and conducting OceanWatch outreach and education activities is also an important aspect of the position.


Primary qualifications include a PhD from an accredited college or university in Oceanography, Marine Biology, Climate Science, or Mathematics and professional experience working with satellite remotely sensed oceanographic data or climate products to quantitatively derive information about biological physical or oceanographic phenomena.  A Master’s degree from an accredited college or university and at least five (5) years of relevant work experience in the above fields may substitute for a PhD.


DEADLINE: Please note the deadline to apply is 11/15/2021
