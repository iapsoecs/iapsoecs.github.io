The University of Bologna opens a research position for a three year
term in Ocean Ensemble Forecasting at the Department of Physics and
Astronomy.

The researcher's activities are linked to the development of the project
entitled: "Development of ensemble predictions for the Mediterranean
Sea" financed by the European Project Horizon 2020 EUROSEA.
The successful applicant will have to design, implement and intercompare
existing perturbation techniques to generate ensembles in the complex
analysis and forecasting system of the Mediterranean Sea. The quality of
the ensemble forecast will have to be evaluated by comparing with the in
situ data. Finally, new indices, so-called Extreme Forecast Indices
(EFIs) will have to be defined and computed to be able to detect
anomalous events for sea level, waves and sea temperatures.
The project has the final aim to transition the ensemble prediction
methodologies from TRL4 to TRL8, i.e. devise an operational system for
use in the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. In addition
it is expected that the work will generate 2-3 open access papers in
peer-reviewed journals.

The research team is led by Prof. Nadia Pinardi.

The application should be sumbitted before September 8, 2020 here:
