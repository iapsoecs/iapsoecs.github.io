The Rosenstiel School and the Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC) at the University of Miami are soliciting applications for tenured or tenure-track faculty positions in the Atmospheric Sciences and Ocean Sciences departments. Applications are sought from scientists who will leverage large data sets, statistical learning techniques, machine learning, and data science to advance knowledge about the oceans and/or atmosphere. These two positions are among five new opportunities across the Rosenstiel School?s five departments, aiming to infuse data science into research and instructional programs across the School. Successful applicants will join several other IDSC-enabled new faculty from across the University, leveraging their teaching-load reductions to help define the future of the Institute, even as their tenure portfolio resides squarely within the departments.

Candidates are expected to teach courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels, mentor students, and maintain an active research program. The successful candidate for a tenured faculty position should have a record of internationally recognized scholarly accomplishments, teaching experience, and a sustained externally funded research program, while successful applicants at the assistant or associate professor level must demonstrate potential to develop an externally funded research program of international reputation. Applicants are expected to demonstrate a commitment to excellence in teaching, mentorship, service and the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion. The candidates are expected to participate in collaborative and interdisciplinary research and to contribute to IDSC?s core mission of fostering inter-disciplinary and data-intensive research across the University of Miami.



Applications will be considered at all ranks. Review of applications is ongoing, and each appointment is expected to start as soon as feasible.  To be eligible, candidates must hold a Ph.D. or terminal degree with a focus on data science in their field by the appointment start date. The application material can be submitted via the UM Careers website (https://umiami.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/UMFaculty) and should include:

  *   Letter of interest that describes your anticipated contributions to scholarship, teaching, and service in the Rosenstiel School (suggested limit of 2 pages)
  *   Current CV
  *   Research statement (2 pages)
  *   Teaching statement (2 pages)
  *   A statement of commitments and contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion (1 page)
  *   The names of three colleagues who can provide us with a reference

The Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science (http://rsmas.miami.edu/) at the University of Miami is a world leader in Earth sciences. Fundamental and interdisciplinary research are focused on understanding the chemical, physical and biological processes controlling the evolution of the marine, atmospheric and terrestrial environments, and the associated human-environment interactions.

The Institute for Data Science and Computing (https://idsc.miami.edu/)'s core mission is to catalyze data-intensive research across the University of Miami focused on the needs of the region and to enhance data science understanding among our students and the public, by leveraging state-of-the-art resources and enabling novel interdisciplinary collaborations across UM and with industry partners.
