Postdoctoral Research Scientist - Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University


Description:

The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Scientist (PDRS) position in Physical Oceanography within the Climate Data Science Lab, under the supervision of Prof. Ryan Abernathey.

The PDRS will conduct research as part of the NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Science Team. The SWOT mission, launching in 2022, will provide new swath-based observations of sea level. Our project team includes PI Shafer Smith at NYU and other collaborators there. The overall goal of our project is to develop new data-driven methods, leveraging ocean dynamics together with machine learning, for inferring ocean transport from SWOT observations of sea surface height. The postdoctoral scientist will use high-resolution global numerical simulations (MITgcm LLC4320) to develop and test methods for reconstructing lateral and vertical transport from SSH, and then apply these methods to the real SWOT data post launch.

The Climate Data Science Lab is a group within Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory devoted to developing cutting-edge computational and data science tools together side-by-side with ambitious science research. The postdoctoral scientist will be embedded within a group that includes students, postdocs and research scientists, as well as software engineers, data scientists. This group values reproducibility, open collaboration, and kindness, providing a supportive environment for career development.

Qualifications:

Candidates should have completed or be nearing completion of a PhD in Physical Oceanography or a closely related discipline, with a record of relevant publications in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Experience analyzing data from high-resolution numerical simulations and satellites is strongly preferred. Candidates must also be fluent in scientific python; experience with Xarray and Dask is preferred.

Initial appointment will be for 1 year, with eligibility for renewal for up to 2 additional years contingent on performance and funding.

This search will remain open for at least 30 days after the ad appears and will continue until the positions are filled.

Columbia University benefits offered with this Officer of Research appointment.
