We have two upcoming postdoctoral positions at the Univ. of East
Anglia (UEA), UK, to work on estimates of air-sea greenhouse gas
fluxes (CO2, N2O, CH4), as part of the Horizon Europe GreenFeedBack
consortium ("Greenhouse Gas Fluxes and Earth System Feedbacks").

A 3-year position to work on the inverse modelling of air-sea GHG
fluxes. Details here:

A  linked 2-year position to work on bottom-up parameterizations of
air-sea GHG fluxes. Details here:
