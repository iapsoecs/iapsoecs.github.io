## Geochemist/Chemical Oceanographer, (full-time)



We encourage members of groups historically underrepresented in science and engineering to apply to this role.

Hourglass Climate is a USA-based non-profit organization with the mission to strategically research the safety and efficacy of mineral-based Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) techniques for responsible carbon removal and climate impact at scale.

The ocean is our greatest resource for capturing hard-to-abate, and historical, carbon dioxide emissions, a non-negotiable part of limiting climate warming to 2ºC, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). OAE via alkaline minerals has the potential for permanent, gigatonne-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with significant co-benefits such as a reduction in ocean acidification. However, targeted, independent and integrated research that rapidly de-risks the key uncertainties around OAE techniques is urgently needed. To do just that, Hourglass brings together an ecosystem of scientists to conduct model, laboratory, and field research for the public benefit.


## Location

San Pedro, CA 

## Salary Range

$87,000 - $124,000

## Start Date

March 1, 2025 or thereafter

## Job Description

Hourglass is seeking an experienced, hands-on geochemist to design and run a variety of laboratory-based geochemical experiments to further our understanding of OAE at Hourglass’s analytical laboratory located in the Southern California Marine Institute (SCMI) in San Pedro, CA. This role will focus on research and experimental work 75% of the time, and will dedicate 25% of their time to managing our laboratory facility, ongoing carbonate system analyses, and team of skilled technicians. 

The ideal candidate is a motivated problem-solver eager to design and execute novel experiments to advance understanding surrounding mineral-based OAE strategies. The experimental work will involve a flow-through reactor system, and the study of geochemical changes to both sediments and water. Research will focus on a host of questions related to mineral based OAE including but not limited to the following:

* Dynamics of mineral dissolution under varying conditions
* Impacts on the inorganic carbon cycle related to alkalinity addition, atmospheric and seawater composition, and secondary mineral precipitation.
* Trace metal cycling and behavior

This detail-oriented individual will guide both experimental work, as well as ongoing carbonate chemistry analyses in our lab facility. We are looking for a team player who seeks to support their colleagues with a “no-task-too-small” mindset, and someone who is driven to produce the highest quality data. This candidate will have a strong interest in leading and contributing to scientific publications, developing new and innovative projects as research trajectories evolve, and building a positive, collaborative, and scientifically rigorous lab environment. This is a full time, in-person position.

The ideal candidate can easily fulfill the responsibilities of this position described below and has the following qualities and experience:

## Responsibilities

* Design and execute geochemical experiments to expand our mechanistic understanding of mineral based OAE strategies (75% time for this and related research activities).
* Publish findings from experimental work consisting of rigorous and high-quality datasets in collaboration with the science team.
* Contribute & Collaborate: bring a depth of geochemical knowledge and ideas to projects across Hourglass including geochemical modeling, interpretation of field data, and/or development of field sampling techniques. The ideal candidate will be curious and motivated to share their knowledge and apply it in new ways.
* Oversee and support ongoing analyses and the maintenance of instrumentation and experimental systems in our laboratory facility; Manage a limited number of lab staff and foster a positive culture of curiosity, scientific rigor, and collaboration (25% time).

## Minimum Qualifications

* PhD in geochemistry, oceanography, or related field.
* Strong independent worker, self-motivated
* Someone who considers themselves a “lab person”; willing to tinker and always be hands-on.
* Publication history in peer reviewed journals
* Familiarity with marine geochemical processes with particular emphasis on the  carbonate system, sediment-water interactions, and porewater systems. 
* Demonstrated experience designing, executing, and publishing geochemical experiments. Specifically, we are seeking a candidate familiar with flow through reactors, mineral dissolution, core incubations, and/or porewater sampling. 
* Experience operating lab instrumentation such as a spectrophotometer, alkalinity titrator, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) analyzer, and/or various water quality sensors.
* Proficiency in data processing and visualization using Python, Matlab, or similar languages/tools. 
* Hands-on, problem-solving attitude; willingness to step in and support no matter the task
* Team player. Demonstrated experience in mentorship, collaboration, and/or direct management.
* Commitment to upholding the highest scientific standards, meticulous attention to detail in planning and procedure.
* Ability to maintain safety and quality control standards.
* Must work in-person at our facility in San Pedro, CA

## Preferred Qualifications

* 1+ years post doctoral experience in geochemistry, oceanography, or related field.
* Experience building, using, and maintaining flow-through experimental setups, core incubations, and/or mineral dissolution experiments; monitoring, sampling, and analyzing gas, water, and sediment samples.
* Experience maintaining and troubleshooting analytical instruments such as water quality sensors, titrators, DIC analyzer, Li-COR, as well as experimental infrastructure.
* Familiarity sampling for trace metals and with trace metal clean practices. Knowledge of trace metal systems and behavior is a plus.
* Comfortable developing and troubleshooting laboratory standard operating procedures and protocols. 	
* Experience with geochemical modeling; using or building models to interpret geochemical datasets; leveraging empirical data to improve geochemical models 
* Broad scientific interest - e.g., eager to apply experimental findings to improve mechanistic models, improve field protocols, build novel monitoring tools, expose gaps in the OAE knowledge base and propose ways to fill them, etc.
