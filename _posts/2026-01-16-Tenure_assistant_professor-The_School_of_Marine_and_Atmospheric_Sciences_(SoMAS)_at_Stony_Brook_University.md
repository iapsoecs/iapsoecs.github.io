## Position:

Assistant Professor (Tenure-Track) in Atmospheric-Ocean Interactions, School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences

## Application link:

https://apply.interfolio.com/179278

## Due date:

February 15, 2026

## Description

Atmosphere-Ocean interactions are crucial for regulating Earth's climate by regulating the exchange of energy, moisture, gases, and aerosols, and are fundamental to weather patterns and extreme events. Despite their importance, critical controlling processes remain poorly understood, underscoring the urgent need to improve Earth system modeling. Significant uncertainties exist, including how ENSO will change with increasing global warming and the impact of the projected slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation on regional climates in eastern North America and western Europe. Furthermore, increasing ocean temperatures are altering the distribution of marine life, including phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish. Changes in ocean biology affect sea spray aerosol, a key driver of extra-tropical mixed-phase clouds, which are responsible for the largest uncertainties in current equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates. To tackle these challenges, SoMAS seeks someone with experience in research on ocean-atmosphere interactions, through conducting observational, modeling, or experimental studies, to complement our existing strength in climate-related research.

## Description of Duties:

The School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS) at Stony Brook University invites applications for a faculty position in Marine Sciences and Atmospheric Sciences. The successful candidate will have a strong commitment to teaching and will teach undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as mentor students.  The candidate will commit to departmental and university service.  SoMAS is a multidisciplinary environment, with opportunities for collaboration within the School to advance its research mission. The candidate will establish and sustain an independent, externally funded research program.

## Qualifications

Ph.D. (or foreign equivalent) in Marine Sciences, Atmospheric Sciences, Climate Sciences, or a related field in hand no later than July 31st, 2026. Expertise and research experience in climate interactions between the ocean and atmosphere. Teaching experience in Marine Sciences and/or Atmospheric Sciences, alongside general research experience in specialized areas. Experience in mentoring students. Demonstrated experience obtaining and managing external research.

## Application Instructions: 

Complete applications should include a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, contact information for at least three (3) professional references, and separate statements of: i) current and proposed research, ii) teaching and outreach philosophy, interests, and previous experiences (e.g., courses, activities); and iii) statement of your experience ensuring a fair, supportive work environment where all colleagues have the opportunity to contribute and succeed. These statements should not be more than two pages each. Applications should be received by February 15th, 2026, for best consideration, although applications will be accepted until the position is filled.
