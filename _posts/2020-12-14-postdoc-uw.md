All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a "Great College to Work For" for six consecutive years.

The University of Washington (UW) is proud to be one of the Nation's premier educational and research institutions. Our people are the most important asset in our pursuit of achieving excellence in education, research, and community service. UW is in the greater Seattle metropolitan area, with a dynamic, multicultural community of 3.7 million people and a range of natural environments from mountains to ocean. The UW is a community of 80,000 students, faculty and staff including 25% first-generation college students, over 25% Pell Grant students and faculty from over 70 countries.

The Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) has existed since 1977 for the purpose of fostering research collaboration between UW and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). CICOES's research is at the forefront of investigations on climate change, ocean acidification, fisheries assessments, and tsunami forecasting.

CICOES has an outstanding opportunity for a Research Scientist in Marine Biogeochemistry. This is a full-time position eligible for benefits. The successful applicant will engage in data processing, management, quality control, and analysis with a team working to advance the biogeochemical (BGC) Argo program (https://biogeochemical-argo.org) at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL:  https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/). CICOES and PMEL scientists will provide guidance to enhance the professional skills and independence of the Research Scientist who will work directly with PMEL scientist Dr. Andrea Fassbender. Specifically, the Research Scientist will contribute to the shore-side maintenance of data flows from autonomous platforms, quality control of biogeochemical datasets, application and improvement of quality assessment tools and protocols, data management, data dissemination and advancement of data products. Depending on experience level, proficiency with job duties, and i
 nterest, the Research Scientist may contribute to and/or lead research projects studying ocean biogeochemistry.

Duties include:

*Use MATLAB, Python, or comparable programming language to process and analyze biogeochemical datasets;

*Ensure receipt, organization, transmission, and archival of data files;

*Identify issues or unusual patterns in BGC sensor data or float diagnostics that require inspection;

*Application and possible advancement of BGC Argo data quality assessment and quality control methods;
