The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) is a multidisciplinary center for climate and Earth system research located in Hamburg, Germany. It is one of the premier climate science research institutes in the world. Located in the heart of one of Europe’s most livable and vibrant cities, it provides a highly international and interdisciplinary environment to conduct scientific research as well as access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities. You can also have a virtual tour to our campus.

 

The MPI-M is now opening 3-year position for

 

TWO Postdoctoral | Research Scientists in Climate Dynamics (W-0007 | all genders)

 

to investigate the dynamical mechanisms for the formation of tropical Pacific climate change pattern. Primary research questions to address are:

    How do we explain the model-observation discrepancy in the tropical Pacific SST pattern change in the recent past?
    How do we reconcile the observed past and projected future changes in the tropical Pacific SST pattern?
    What is the relative importance of local and remote drivers of tropical Pacific SST pattern changes in the past and future?

 

The successful candidates will be part of the director’s research group in the new Climate Dynamics Department, which focuses on the use of model hierarchies to develop and test ideas for understanding the teleconnection pathways that drive the tropical climate pattern changes.

 

Positions are offered for 3 years, with the possibility of extension to 6 years, subject to the availability of funding.
