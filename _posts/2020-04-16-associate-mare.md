Ma-Re seeks an Early Career Research Associate to contribute to the international project 'Humpback Whales in a Changing Climate', which is a collaboration between South Africa, Australia and South America. The candidate will be requested to implement the ocean-sea ice-biogeochemistry modelling component of the project for Southern Ocean simulations (based on the NEMO system). The model will be used to determine environmental conditions for the humpback feeding grounds around Antarctica over the past 40 years. The interaction with animal ecology will be analysed jointly with international experts and other agent-based modelling undertaken by the other partners in the project.

The candidate must have proven experience in sea ice and/or ocean dynamics, either at regional or global scales, and skills in data analysis and visualization. A publication record of peer-reviewed articles pertaining to numerical modelling is required. Knowledge of biogeochemical models is not a prerequisite but will be considered an advantage. The candidate is expected to work independently as the lead researcher of a junior group consisting of another post-doc and a few MSc/PhD students. She/he will help co-supervise these students and assist the PI A/Prof Marcello Vichi in running the international project. Participation in international meetings will be required, as well as the preparation of intermediate and annual scientific reports.

This is a fixed-term contract appointment for a maximum of 2 years and is contingent upon satisfactory performance and deliverables after the first year. (see T1 contract at <http://www.hr.uct.ac.za/hr/service/current_policy_contract>) Ma-Re is a UCT research grouping hosted by the Department of Oceanography that focuses on interdisciplinary science in collaboration with the Dept. of Biological Sciences and the Faculty of Engineering. Gross salary range is from R600,000 to R700,000 per annum, according to experience, with the addition of a relocation allowance for international applicants that is inclusive of flight and 15 days accommodation in a single room or studio apartment (max R50,000). For non-South African applicants, the appointment will be subject to a work visa. Given the current COVID-19 global emergency, the commencement date for this appointment in South Africa remains open.

The possibility of remote employment will be explored to allow commencement of the activity by June 2020 (or earlier).

To apply, send an email application to marcello.vichi@uct.ac.za <mailto:marcello.vichi@uct.ac.za> with the subject 'Whales & Climate Application' and attach the following: a covering letter describing research experience, interests, and collaborative experience; a curriculum vitae; and 2 reference letters. Applications will be accepted until 1st May 2020. Remote interviews will start immediately and the appointment will be confirmed within one month.
