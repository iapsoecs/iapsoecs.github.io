A postdoctoral position in ocean, atmosphere and climate modelling is available as part of collaboration between LOCEAN (Sorbonne University/CNRS/IRD/MNHN) and Yale University. The project is led by Drs. Alexey Fedorov, Eric Guilyardi, and Juliette Mignot. The focus of the project is relatively broad and includes the impacts of global warming on tropical oceans, tropical basin interactions, and ENSO dynamics in a warming climate. Initial investigation will include the contribution of individual tropical basins to global warming. There could also be opportunities to work on variability, change and impacts of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and its role in global climate. The work will involve numerical climate modeling, and analyses of observational and GCM data. A PhD in physical oceanography, atmospheric sciences or related disciplines is required. Previous experience with ocean, atmospheric or climate GCMs is highly desirable. Successful postdoctoral candidates will be based at the Pierre et Marie Curie campus of Sorbonne University in the heart of Paris during the first year and at Yale University during the second year, but other arrangements can also be made. There is also a possibility of renewal for a third year.

Postdoctoral applicants should email their CV, a statement of research interests, one reprint or preprint, and the names of three referees to Drs. Alexey Fedorov, Eric Guilyardi and Juliette Mignot 
(alexey.fedorov@yale.edu; Eric.Guilyardi@locean.ipsl.fr; juliette.mignot@locean.ipsl.fr; subject: LOCEAN/Yale postdoctoral search). Review of applications will start immediately (March 10, 2024) and will continue until the position is filled. This position is available starting April 1, 2024. Shortlisted candidates will be contacted.
