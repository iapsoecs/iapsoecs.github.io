Position Details:

The Syracuse University Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences seeks applicants for a tenure-track Assistant Professorship in Cryosphere and Polar Science. We seek an outstanding scholar with demonstrated excellence in research and teaching in any aspect of ice and snow dominated systems in polar regions, alpine systems, and/or high latitudes incorporating field observations, remote sensing, geodetic/geophysical, theoretical, and/or model-based methods. This includes the study of cryosphere interactions with the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and/or solid earth.

    Areas of expertise that are of particular interest include: cold regions response to global change, snow hydrology, geomorphology of arctic and alpine environments, Arctic or Antarctic systems science, biogeochemistry of polar environments, and/or the physics and dynamics of permafrost, ice-sheets, glaciers, or sea-ice.
    Ph.D. required at the time appointment.

We welcome candidates who can contribute to an inclusive environment, bring new perspectives on mentoring students from diverse backgrounds, implement novel approaches to quantitative research, and who value collegiality and collaboration. The ideal candidate will collaborate across traditional disciplinary boundaries in support of ongoing initiatives at the Department, College, and University levels in the areas of water, energy, and climate.
