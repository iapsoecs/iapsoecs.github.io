The Ocean Modelling and Fluids Group under the Department of Ocean
Science at HKUST has funding for two Post-doctoral Fellows. The idea is
for the candidate to work on one (or more) areas listed below, and to
pursue their own research agenda, with exact splitting of time
negotiable. The possible topics are (in order of priority):

1) impact of mesoscale eddy parameterisations on ocean climate
projection exercises;
2) parameter inference using inverse methods and state estimates in the
oceanography context;
3) stirring, dispersion and transport of passive/active tracers in the
coastal/regional context;
4) statistical physics methods and its applications to climate sciences
(e.g. melt ponds, tropical convection)

Please see official advert for the official details. The application
pack should include minimally a cover letter, research statement and
CV, the whole pack not totalling not more than 7 pages, to be sent to
jclmak@ust.hk, indicating somewhere which of the topics above is being
pursued. Interested candidates from more traditional academic
backgrounds as well as more nonlinear backgrounds are encouraged to
contact jclmak@ust.hk for informal and non-binding queries about the
position (e.g. details of topic, appointment length, salary etc.).
Applications are considered until positions are filled, and interviews
will be made roughly on a monthly basis.
