Global Multi-Scale Ocean Carbon Observatory (GOCO) Postdoctoral Fellowship

Applications are now open until 11:59 PM on January 5, 2026 for fellowships beginning in 2026

We invite applications for an eighteen-month Postdoctoral Fellowship to advance innovation in marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR), Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV), and ocean–climate observations. The postdoc will be based at WHOI and collaborate with a team of Principal Investigators (PIs) and postdocs across the participating institutions: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), Ocean Frontier Institute (OFI), and Stanford University. Together, the international team will collaborate on shared research that accelerates ocean-climate observations and scalable, verifiable, and equitable ocean-based carbon removal, with emphasis on Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE). The team will conduct fundamental and applied research to improve understanding of biogeochemical and ecosystem responses to OAE, while developing and testing approaches for field-based MRV, testbed coordination, and finance and governance innovation. This integrated framework ensures that research is scientifically rigorous, environmentally responsible, and globally impactful, supporting a coherent multi-institutional strategy for advancing ocean-climate observations and evaluating ocean-based climate solutions.

The WHOI-based fellow will focus on topics related to modelling and researching ship-based dispersal pathways, open-ocean MRV and ecosystem feedback, as well as US East Coast testbed development through the Ocean Vital Signs Network (OVSN).
