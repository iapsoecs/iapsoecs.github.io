**PostDoc in ocean biogeochemical modelling with focus on overshoot scenarios**

The Ocean Modelling group of the Climate and Environmental Physics Division at the University of Bern is seeking applications for a postdoc position in the area of ocean biogeochemical modeling. The postdoc will assess reversible and irreversible changes in physical
and biogeochemical properties of the ocean under future scenarios that temporarily overshoot the Paris Agreement temperature thresholds. The focus will be on extreme events
and the crossing of important tipping points in ocean biogeochemistry. Simulations will be
conducted with NOAA’s GFDL fully coupled Earth system model. The research will be embedded within the recently funded European project PROVIDE, which aims at delivering
highly innovative and integrative climate services that incorporate comprehensive information on impacts under overshoot pathways form the global to the regional level, directly
feeding into adaptation action.

The project offers the opportunity to work with a comprehensive climate-carbon cycle Earth
system model and to collaborate with fisheries scientists at University of British Columbia,
who will use the model simulation output for fisheries impact analysis. In addition, the researcher will profit from being an active part of the dynamical ocean modeling group. The
candidate will present results at international scientific meetings and publish in peer-reviewed literature. The candidate is also encouraged to work on related topics and to develop
her/his own projects. The salary is according to the guidelines of the University of Bern. The
term of appointment is for two years.

We are looking for an outstanding postdoctoral researcher with a PhD in oceanography,
Earth sciences, physics, mathematics, or related fields. Candidates with a strong background in climate modeling, the analysis of large datasets and in ocean biogeochemistry
are preferred. The position requires the ability and interest to work across disciplines, and
the proven ability to work independently.
Applications should include a motivation letter, CV, publication list, web link to the PhD
thesis, and the contact details of three references. The application should be submitted as
a single pdf file to Prof. Thomas Frölicher (thomas.froelicher@climate.unibe.ch). Consideration of applications begins on September 24. The project start is preferentially in 2021 or
early 2022.
