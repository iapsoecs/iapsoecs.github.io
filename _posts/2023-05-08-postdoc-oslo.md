A Postdoctoral Research Fellow position is available at the Section for Meteorology and Oceanography (“MetOs”) within the Department of Geosciences at the University of Oslo.

The appointment is a full-time position, for a period of two years. The preferred starting date is 15 August, 2023.

No one can be appointed for more than one Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Oslo.

The position is funded under the «Rough Ocean» project, financed by the Norwegian Research Council. The goal is to improve understanding on the effects of bottom topography on large scale oceanic flows, including the vertical structure of time-varying currents, the stability of jets and planetary waves, and the dynamics of bottom-intensifed waves. We will study oceanic processes both at middle and at high latitudes, specifically in the Arctic. The project is being conducted in collaboration with scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California San Diego, at Florida State University and at the Ecole Normale Superieur de Paris (ENS).

The position is based in Oslo, Norway. The applicant will in addition spend up to one month per year at Florida State University, analyzing output from a state-of-the-art numerical simulation of the North Atlantic. The position offers unique networking opportunities, with close collaboration with groups in the US, Norway, France and Sweden. In addition to the extended visits to the partner institution(s), there will be ample opportunities to attend international conferences. Oslo offers many cultural and natural attractions to enjoy as well.

The successful applicant will become a member of the Department of Geosciences and of the Section for Meteorology and Oceanography (MetOs) in particular. MetOs has a dynamic and growing group of PhD students and post-docs who are keen to interact. The main goal is to provide the candidate with enhanced skills to pursue a scientific top position within or outside academia.
