The National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado 
has an open position for a sea ice postdoctoral researcher. The purpose
of this position is to conduct original research on the factors driving
variations in the sea ice surface albedo evolution and to incorporate that
knowledge into sea ice models. This will make use of observations from the
MOSAiC field campaign and model simulations from the CICE sea ice model and
the Community Earth System Model. It will result in the development of sea
ice model parameterizations.
