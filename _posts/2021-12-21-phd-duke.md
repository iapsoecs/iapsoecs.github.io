The Climate Dynamics Lab in the Division of Earth and Climate Sciences,
Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University has an open PhD
position to start in Fall 2022. The main goal of our lab is to understand
the role of air-sea coupling in global climate change and variability by
combining theory, observations, and climate modeling. The prospective
student will have the flexibility to develop a PhD project in a broad range
of topics, including but not limited to global warming pattern formation,
ocean inter-basin teleconnection, El Nino dynamics, and paleoclimate.

The application deadline is January 10th, 2022. Applications from
underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged. More details about the
PhD program can be found on the website below.
