**Permanent researcher position in biogeochemistry, IFREMER, Brest, France**

Ifremer is offering a permanent researcher position in biogeochemistry. The researcher will propose and carry-on original research projects to characterize the origin, fluxes and stocks of allochthonous (rivers, sediments) and autochthonous (phytoplankton) organic matter at the marine coastal zone interfaces. These works on fluxes will contribute to the quantification of matter balances in the coastal zones. The studies could consider various spatial (local to regional) and temporal (high-frequency to pluriannual) scales.

Deadline for applications: 21 September 2021.
