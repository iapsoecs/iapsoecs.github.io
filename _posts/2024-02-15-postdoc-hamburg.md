Postdoctoral Research Associate for the Project “PalMod Phase III” Examining the response of the ocean carbon storage to abrupt events during the last deglaciation.


Institution: Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences, Department of Earth System Sciences

Salary level: EGR. 14 TV-L

Start date: as soon as possible, fixed until 31.12.2026 (This is a fixed-term contract in accordance with Section 2 of the academic fixed-term labor contract act [Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz, WissZeitVG]).

Application deadline: 31.03.2024

Scope of work: full-time position suitable for part-time


**Your responsibilities**

Duties include academic services in the project named above. Research associates may also pursue independent research and further academic qualifications.

The Project PalMod Phase III is a project between Universität Hamburg and several other German research institutes and universities, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF), to understand Earth system dynamics and variability during the last glacial cycle.

Model simulations in PalMod Phase II with cryosphere-ocean-atmosphere interactions in MPI-ESM have captured some features of the abrupt events of the last deglaciation (Heinrich events, Bølling-Allerød warming, Younger Dryas). Studies of marine sediments show that such abrupt events profoundly affect ocean biogeochemistry. Nevertheless, the cascades of changes in oceanic biogeochemistry have not yet been examined using comprehensive Earth system models with interactive carbon cycle. The planned work will address this knowledge gap. The project will focus on examining the response of the ocean carbon storage and biogeochemical cycles to abrupt events in MPI-ESM projections spanning the last deglaciation and future climate change scenarios with the goal to improve our quantitative understanding of the observed cascades of change.

Successful candidate will be part of a vibrant research group working in Earth system modeling focusing on the global carbon cycle. Responsibilities will include:

- performing and analysis of simulations with the Earth system model MPI-ESM, focusing on its biogeochemical component HAMOCC

- performing time-slice simulations with MPI-ESM focusing on periods of interest with high climate variability

- analyze abrupt events in transient simulations focusing on cascading effects in ocean biogeochemistry

- contribute to project reporting and coordination

- disseminating the results through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences

Funding is available for 3 years following an approval of a cost neutral extension.

**Your profile**

A university degree in a relevant field plus doctorate.

- a PhD in oceanography, geoscience, environmental sciences, or a related field is required for this position

- compelling understanding of ocean biogeochemical dynamics, in particular regarding its role in Earth’s climate

- experience with ocean carbon cycle models, skill in model development

- strong programming skills in Fortran, post-processing and visualization software (e.g., python, CDO), as well as experience in handling large data sets

- strong communication and organizational skills and an ability to effectively communicate results of scientific research to project members and international colleagues.
