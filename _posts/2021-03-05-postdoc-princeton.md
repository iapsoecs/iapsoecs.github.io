The AOS Programâ€™s ocean biogeochemistry group seeks energetic and enthusiastic postdoctoral or more senior researchers to participate in process-oriented studies using theory, modeling, and observations to develop understanding at the intersection of ocean physics and biogeochemistry. This effort is part of a broad study of ocean circulation, the global carbon cycle, and climate change. Of particular interest is how ocean dynamics at a range of spatial scales - from submesoscale/mesoscale fronts and eddies to regional, basin, and global scale circulations - impacts the cycling of carbon, nutrients, and oxygen, with an emphasis on the Southern Ocean.

Individuals will join a vigorous interdisciplinary research group under the direction of Professor Curtis Deutsch at Princeton University and in close collaboration with collaborators at the member institutions of the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project sponsored by NSF Polar Programs. Available resources include state-of-the-science ocean physics and biogeochemistry models and observational data sets of Southern Ocean biogeochemistry with unprecedented temporal and spatial coverage.

Candidates must have received a Ph.D. in the earth sciences, applied math, or the physical, biological, or chemical sciences. Rigorous training in oceanic sciences is preferred along with very strong dynamical, modeling, and quantitative skills. Postdoctoral appointments are initially for one year with the renewal for subsequent years based on satisfactory performance and continued funding. A competitive salary is offered commensurate with experience and qualifications.

Applicants are asked to submit a cover letter, vitae, a publication list, a statement of research experience and interests, and names of at least 3 references. Applicants should apply online to <https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/19561>.

Review of applications will begin as soon as they are received and continue until the position is filled. This position is subject to the University's background check policy.
