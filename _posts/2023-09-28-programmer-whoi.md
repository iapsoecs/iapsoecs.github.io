Job Summary

Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is currently searching for a Data Scientist / Scientific Programmer to join the Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department. This is a regular, full-time, exempt position, and is eligible for benefits.

A data scientist / scientific programmer is sought to contribute a new initiative to develop innovative capacity for co-design of ocean observing and modeling systems in support of carbon cycle science and climate solutions. A central role for the successful candidate will be to contribute to a new NSF-supported five-year initiative between Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to advance regional ocean modeling and data assimilation with a focus on carbon cycling.
The internal working title for this position could be either Information Associate I, Information Associate II, or Information Associate III. The final level of the position will be determined commensurate with the selected candidate's level of education & experience.

Essential Functions

The successful candidate will join a collaborative WHOI team pioneering advancements in ocean observations and the development of innovative data products. The candidate will contribute to designing a new community-oriented observational array, the Ocean Vital Signs Network (OVSN) - a regional open ocean system - and help develop a data pipeline for ingestion into models and state estimation systems. Specific responsibilities will include taking a leading role in developing community tools to aid observing system design experiments and data assimilation frameworks that will be vetted using the OVSN as a testbed.

Education & Experience

The successful candidate must have a Bachelor?s degree in Earth Science, Computer Science or other relevant STEM field.
A Masters or Ph.D. in a related field, and 3 or more years of relevant experience are desired.

Desired Skills

- Strong programming skills in python, Julia, or similar. Experience with fortran also a plus;

- Experience working with observational data sets or large model output files;
- Experience working with high performance computing (HPC) and/or cloud computing environments;
- Familiarity or interest in frameworks for combining geophysical models and observations, including the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) and other data assimilation frameworks;
- Some understanding of large-scale oceanography and carbon cycling;
- Ability to multitask and meet strict deadlines;
- Ability to work independently but within a team context;
- Strong communication and organization skills;
- Experience with web development and/or relational databases.
