We seek a researcher with experience in computer modelling to assess the relative impact of changes in climate and other environmental drivers on the Southern Ocean CO2 sink during the period 1950-2100, using a global model at two different physical resolutions (2 and Â¼ degrees). This 2-year post-doc is part of the NERC projects SONATA and CELOS. (https://roses.ac.uk/).
