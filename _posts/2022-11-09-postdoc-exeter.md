The College wishes to recruit either a Postdoctoral Research Associate or a Graduate Research Assistant to support the work of Dr Jamie Shutler. This European Space Agency funded post is available immediately. The successful applicant will work within the European Space Agency (ESA) project Ocean Health â€“ Ocean Acidification which is aiming to further develop the use of satellite observation-based methods for studying and monitoring ocean acidification. This is a European project that includes teams at Plymouth Marine Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Ifremer and a small company called Ocean Data Lab. The successful candidate will be using satellite, model and in situ data to study the marine carbonate system and ocean acidification, with a focus on supporting conservation, and advising mitigation and management decisions (eg for supporting decision making in US and Canadian west-coast states and Pacific ocean small island nations). This will primarily involve i) designing and implementing experiments to study how marine heat waves are impacting the marine carbonate system and how this knowledge can be used to guide mitigation and ii) leading the uncertainty assessment of all data produced by the project teams.
The post will include the design of experiments, scientific software development (eg in Python), statistical analyses of any results, presenting results at project meetings and the co-authoring of journal publications. This is a 15 month fixed length contract with a possibility of extending (subject to funding).

Closing date: November 15, 2022
