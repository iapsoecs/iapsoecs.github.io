The Centre for Coastal Ecosystem and Climate Change Research (CoastClim), established at the Tvärminne Zoological Station (TZS), Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences at the University of Helsinki (Finland), is seeking an enthusiastic PhD candidate with an interest in global change and more specifically in marine (pelagic) biogeochemistry.

Within CoastClim, the successful candidate will explore the connections between biodiversity and carbon cycling in coastal habitats and assess their impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics including CO₂ and CH₄. Fieldwork and in-situ experiments will focus on: i) investigating the importance of temporal variability, including seasonal ecosystem successions, on the intensity of sea-air GHG exchanges in coastal ecosystems, ii) identifying GHG hotspots in coastal environments by examining contrasting seafloor habitats and quantifying their GHG release into the water column, and iii) assessing the impacts of heatwaves on local biodiversity and GHG dynamics.

Applicants should have completed both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree by spring 2025. As this is a multidisciplinary research project, applicants with a background in ecology, biology, chemistry, environmental sciences, oceanography, or related fields are encouraged to apply. Experience or interest in statistical programming and computing (e.g., Matlab, R) is a strong advantage, as is experience in field and laboratory work (though not required). Strong communication, presentation, and academic writing skills in English are essential. Collaboration within the multidisciplinary team will be essential.

The candidate will be expected to present the research at conferences, to publish in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, and participate in departmental seminars. Overall, the candidate is expected to be interested in solving multi-scale challenges, to possess a curious and analytical mindset, and to be creative in approaching scientific questions.

Supervision, Funding and Conditions:
The PhD student will be supervised by Dr. Nicolas-Xavier Geilfus, with additional expertise provided by CoastClim researchers. The PhD position is funded for 4 years from the agreed starting date. The PhD scholarship is 2200 €/month. A six-month trial period will apply. The University of Helsinki offers comprehensive services to its employees, including occupational healthcare.

Application Instructions:
Please send your application as a single PDF file by 31st January 2025 to Dr. N.-X. Geilfus at nicolas-xavier.geilfus@helsinki.fi. The application should include:

* Curriculum Vitae (CV) or resume (max. 2 pages), outlining your education, experience, language skills, and any other relevant qualifications.
* Motivation letter (max. 2 pages), detailing your research interests, relevant background, and why you are a good fit for the position.
* Contact information for one to three professional references.

The position is based at Tvärminne Zoological Station, where we offer a dynamic, multidisciplinary, and international research environment, and where you will have the opportunity to grow and contribute to cutting-edge science.

About the University of Helsinki:
Founded in 1640, the University of Helsinki is one of the world’s leading multidisciplinary research institutions, with a vibrant academic community of 40000 students and staff members. The university operates across four campuses in Helsinki and 15 other locations.

About Tvärminne Zoological Station:
Tvärminne Zoological Station, located in the archipelago of southern Finland, is part of the Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences. It serves as a centre for high-quality biological research, environmental monitoring, and offers facilities for visiting scientists, field courses, and seminars. The station, founded in 1902, is renowned for its long-term environmental data and is a hub for the Centre for Coastal Ecosystem and Climate Change Research (CoastClim), which investigates the relationship between coastal biodiversity, carbon cycling, and climate feedback. CoastClim is a strategic partnership between the University of Helsinki and Stockholm University, strengthening collaborative research on marine ecosystems and climate change.
