We invite applications for a fully-funded PhD position in ocean dynamics and paleoclimate modeling at the University of Bergen. This position is affiliated with the strategic project at the Bjerknes Centre:

"DYnamics of the North Atlantic Surface and Overturning ciRculation - DYNASOR"

One focus of this project is the so-called "warming hole" of the North Atlantic. While the similarity between this cooling and the fingerprint of AMOC weakening in climate models has been used to argue that the decline in circulation present in virtually all simulations of future climate is already underway, recent observations call the hypothesized mechanism into question. This debate highlights both the complexity and urgency of contextualizing the changing subpolar North Atlantic. Here we will focus on two fundamental aspects underlying the current uncertainty, (1) the interaction of surface gyre and deep overturning circulation, and (2) a paleoceanographic perspective of natural variability in the region.

Possible approaches, to be adapted to the candidate's research interests, include the analysis of model simulations, including large ensembles. The Bjerknes Centre has access to state-of-the-art computing infrastructure. A second part of the project involves direct simulations of paleoceanographic archives to enable direct comparison with reconstructed variability.
