This role is an exciting opportunity to work on the interplay between biology and physics on ocean carbon sequestration by the Biological Carbon Pump.

You will run an ocean biogeochemical model (PISCES) with different climate change scenarios and biogeochemical model complexities over centennial and millennial timescales. This will allow you to identify the key drivers of biological carbon storage in a changing ocean and provide the much-needed long-term future context for the role of the Biological Carbon Pump as a carbon reservoir in the wider Earth System. This research will also inform the efficacy of proposed marine Carbon Dioxide removal techniques.

Prior experience with Earth System Modelling is beneficial but applicants with a strong background in the Biological Carbon Pump or ocean biogeochemistry who are interested in developing or diversifying into modelling are also welcomed. Specific training with the ocean biogeochemical model would be available.

The role is part of the PRECOG project which is a new project with the UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship which aims to quantify how and why carbon sequestration in the ocean from the Biological Carbon Pump will change in a future changing climate and the impact this has on the wider carbon cycle. You will also be a part of the Ocean Sciences research group at Liverpool, which is a dynamic group working across ocean physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology using a range of modelling and observational-experimental approaches.

You will work closely with Dr Jamie Wilson and a second postdoctoral researcher specialising in quantifying the Biological Carbon Pump in existing IPCC projections and a PhD researcher. You will also spend time visiting the project partners institutes for short periods of time. PRECOG has collaborations with the National Oceanography Centre; University of East Anglia; University of York; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (France); AXA Research Fund; and the international research network JETZON.

You will also be part of the Department of Earth Oceans and Ecological Science, and wider University. We provide a strongly supportive environment for postdoctoral researchers and the university is a signatory to the Researcher Development Concordat, and provides networking and development opportunities through the successful Prosper portal.

You should have a PhD in Ocean Biogeochemistry or related discipline (Environmental Science or Earth System Science).

This post is fixed term until 31 July 2028.

This role is eligible for sponsorship under the skilled worker route.
