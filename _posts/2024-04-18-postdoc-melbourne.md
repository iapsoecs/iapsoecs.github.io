The University of Melbourne is seeking a three-year postdoctoral fellowship as part of the new ARC Centre of Excellence for the Weather of the 21st Century. The post-doctoral fellow will conduct research on the coastal wind energy resource in Australia.


We are looking for a highly qualified and motivated candidate with experience in mesoscale dynamics, complex geophysical datasets, and high-performance computing to examine how the land-sea breeze circulation influences the coastal wind resource in mid-latitude and tropical Australia.

The goal of this position is to quantify the role that sea breezes play in defining the coastal wind energy resource, at both current and future turbine heights, with particular attention to the coupling between the atmosphere and coastal surface temperature gradients.

 
This position will be based in Melbourne, Australia (visa sponsorship is available for the right candidate) 

Salary: AUD $80,258 - $108,906 p.a.  (*PhD entry level $101,460 p.a.) plus 17% super.


Your responsibilities will include:

•             Significantly contribute towards the research effort of the Centre Project Weather Resources and develop your research expertise with an increasing degree of autonomy.

•             Under the guidance and support of Centre staff conduct internationally competitive research, resulting in publications in high impact journals.

•             Actively participate in research seminars and conferences to disseminate research findings as opportunities arise.

•             Contribute to the preparation, or where appropriate individual preparation of research proposal submissions to internal or external funding bodies as relevant.

 

Who We Are Looking For

You will ideally have expertise in meteorology and atmospheric processes, and be motivated by working on meaningful science problems. The ideal candidate will have a strong research background with publications, and the ability to engage in collaborative partnerships. Additionally, you should excel in communication, teamwork, meeting deadlines, and independently managing research projects.

 

You will also have:

•             Completion (or near completion) of a PhD in Climate Science or a related discipline.

•             Demonstrated knowledge of mesoscale meteorology, coastal processes, and high-resolution modelling

•             Strong computational skills in a programming environment such as Python.

•             Demonstrated capacity to publish in high quality peer reviewed journals.
