Apply now! Deadline February 5, 2024.


A research project is at the heart of the Summer Student Fellowship at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/educate/undergraduate-programs/summer-student-fellowship/) (WHOI). Fellows have the opportunity to conduct research with access to more than two hundred practicing scientists and engineers and the facilities of a major oceanographic institution. Project topics span the spectrum of research in ocean sciences and engineering conducted in WHOI's science departments and the Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center of the U.S. Geological Survey.

Potential projects for 2024 are posted here:

Fellowship recipients also participate in seminars, professional development, cohort activities, and a hands-on, one-day, ocean sampling cruise on board the R/V Tioga focusing on data collection and sampling methods with advanced oceanographic technology and instruments.

Fellows have many occasions to interact with current MIT-WHOI Joint Program graduate students in their research groups, during Q&A sessions and the Ethics in Science Workshop, and in a near-peer mentoring program.

The fellowship provides a stipend of $680/week, as well as housing and a travel allowance. The program duration is a minimum of 10 weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks. The start and end dates are flexible - students arrive between the end of May to mid-June.

Students from groups underrepresented in ocean science and engineering are encouraged to apply.

Requirements: Undergraduate STEM majors who will have completed their junior year are eligible. International students may apply. (Students who will graduate before the program begins are not eligible.)
