NOAA Ocean Exploration is excited to announce that the application for the

This year, the Explorer-in-Training Program will feature two paid
internship options: (a) 2 to 4-week expedition-based opportunities
supporting ocean mapping operations on the Okeanos Explorer and (b) 10-week

opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge through long-term
projects supported by NOAA Ocean Exploration mentors. The expedition-based
