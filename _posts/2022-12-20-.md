We are seeking an outstanding researcher who has well-developed skills in the field of Ocean Colour
Remote Sensing and optical oceanography (2-yr project). The project aims to better understand the
corals and seagrass diversity at different spatiotemporal scales in the Arabian Gulf, using a combination
of field observations, radiative transfer simulations and satellite remote sensing. Moreover, a set of
instruments for the determination of hyperspectral absorption and scattering properties of water as
well as algorithms for their estimation from earth observations will be developed and used.
The individual in this position will work on satellite data from various ocean color satellite sensors and
field measurements from ocean and atmosphere to develop, validate, and evaluate algorithms for the
remote retrieval of the ocean color to detect and map corals and seagrass for the Arabian Gulf coastal
line. Strong programming skills are required and demonstrated ability to develop and improve
algorithms for ocean color products including the atmospheric intervention.

Position Requirements

 PhD in remote sensing, oceanography or a related discipline preferably with some postdoctoral experience.
 Experience in analyzing data from various satellite sensors, e.g., Sentinel, MERIS, MODIS, etc.
 Experience in field ocean color NASA protocols of radiometric measurements using the hyperspectral sensors and correction of in-situ measurements.
 Experience in advanced processing regional ocean color data using SeaDAS, ENVI-IDL, Matlab, Python, FORTRAN and/or other data processing software packages.
 Experience in evaluating and recalibrating ocean color algorithms using in situ measurements.
 Experience in evaluating aerosol retrievals and developing aerosol retrieval algorithm.
 Appropriate skills in batch processing large data sets and satellite database management.
 Hands-on experience in using ESRI software ArcGIS Desktop and ability to integrate imagery with other GIS data.
 Demonstrated ability to publish research findings in peer reviewed journals.
 Excellent communication skills in English scientific writing/publishing and presentation.

The application package should include:

 Curriculum Vitae including a list of publications.
 Sample of relevant published research papers.
 A list of 3 potential referees.
 Applications should be submitted by email to Dr. Maryam Rashed Al Shehhi (maryamr.alshehhi@ku.ac.ae). The expected starting date is during first quarter of 2023.

While we thank all applicants for their interest, only those under consideration will be contacted for a
follow-up interview.
