Employer: IBS Center for Climate Physics

Location: Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea

Education Level: PhD

Job type: Postdoctoral Fellow

Salary: 54 million KRW/year (~43,000 USD)

Term: Full Time, 2 years, with possibility for renewal

Applicants for this position should have a PhD in physics, climate sciences, meteorology, oceanography, geography or a related field. Candidates are expected to have strong computational skills, excitement to work on a new research subject, a good publication record, a high level of independence, curiosity and creativity, and an interest in working in an international and interdisciplinary research environment. The successful candidate will work with Prof. Wonsun Park to investigate the mechanisms of natural circulation variability in the Southern Ocean, and its response to greenhouse warming. This includes analyzing a suite of new ultra-high-resolution climate model simulations, conducted with the global OpenIFS-FESOM and OpenIFS-NEMO models. The candidate will also participate in activities to couple interactive ice shelf-ice sheet models into high resolution earth system models.

The IBS Center for Climate Physics (ICCP), (http://iccp.ibs.re.kr) directed by Dr. Axel Timmermann, is dedicated to advancing the understanding of natural climate variability, man-made climate change and their impacts on the hydrological cycle, regional processes, ice-sheets, and sea level. The ICCP is generously funded through the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) (http://ibs.re.kr). 

Please submit a cover letter (using the reference PD-03-2022), a short statement of your research interests, curriculum vitae, the name of 2 references, and up to three publications to Ms. Jenny Choi (hahadaye@pusan.ac.kr). The review of the applications will start on August 15th, 2022. If you have any further questions regarding this position, please contact Wonsun Park (wonsun.park@gmail.com).
