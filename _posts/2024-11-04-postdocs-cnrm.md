**The Future Evolution of Global Ocean Overturning Cells at Different Global Warming Levels**

Supervisors: Jean-Baptiste Sallée, Roland Séférian

Project Overview:
The project focuses on understanding how global ocean overturning circulation systems,
particularly the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Bottom
Meridional Overturning Circulation (BMOC), will evolve under various levels of global
warming. This research is crucial to improving predictions of long-term climate change and
informing effective climate policies. While there is substantial understanding of climate
change during active warming, climate change after stabilization of global surface air
temperatures are not as well understood. This phase—referred to as "committed climate
change"—is key to evaluating the long-term impacts of policies that target specific
temperature thresholds (such as 1.5°C, 2°C, and beyond).

The project will leverage a unique set of multi-century simulations already performed using
the CNRM Earth System Model. These simulations simulate the climate system's response
to a sudden stabilization of external forcing at various levels of global warming ranging from
1.1°C to 5°C above pre-industrial levels. The specific objectives include:

● Analyzing the response of the ocean overturning circulation at multi-centennial timescales following stabilization at each warming level.

● Investigating the processes that drive the stabilization, recovery, or potential collapse of the AMOC and BMOC under different global warming scenarios.

● Examining how the ocean’s role in heat and carbon storage evolves in these scenarios and how it impacts climate stabilization and feedback mechanisms.

The successful candidate will primarily analyze existing model output from simulations
already run for the project. These simulations cover several centuries post-stabilization,
allowing detailed investigation of the ocean’s long-term behavior. However, the opportunity
exists to perform additional sensitivity simulations, depending on the specific scientific
questions arising from the analysis.

The tools used will include state-of-the-art climate model diagnostics, with a focus on ocean
dynamics, thermohaline processes, and deep-water formation patterns in both the Atlantic
and Southern Oceans.

Required/Desired Skills:

We are seeking a highly motivated candidate with the following background:

● A PhD in climate science, physical oceanography, atmospheric science, or a related field.

● Strong skills in climate modeling, data analysis, and ocean dynamics.

● Experience with Earth System Models and knowledge of ocean circulation

● Proficiency in scientific programming (e.g., Python, MATLAB, Fortran) for climate data analysis is essential.

Research Environment:

The postdoc will be recruited by Sorbonne Université (Paris) and be based at CNRM (Centre
National de Recherches Météorologiques), part of Météo-France, in Toulouse, France.
CNRM is a leading climate and weather research institute with cutting-edge computational
resources and a vibrant scientific community, offering an excellent environment for
collaboration and interdisciplinary research. The successful applicant will join, and active and
dynamic group of scientists, and early career scientist working in related fields.

Application:

To apply, please submit:
● A CV
● A brief cover letter outlining your research experience and interests
● Contact information for two academic references

**Investigating Ocean-Sea Ice-Atmosphere Feedbacks in Antarctica to Understand Self-Sustained Changes in Sea Ice**

Supervision: Jean-Baptiste Sallée, Aurore Voldoire

Located: CNRM, Météo-France, Toulouse, France

Since 2016, Antarctic sea ice has experienced an abrupt and unprecedented decline, which
has puzzled the scientific community and raised questions about the underlying processes
driving such rapid changes. Understanding the complex interactions between the ocean, sea
ice, and atmosphere in the Antarctic region is essential to uncovering the mechanisms
behind this phenomenon and to predicting future sea ice variability in a warming world. This
postdoctoral research project will focus on exploring the feedback processes within the
ocean-sea ice-atmosphere system that may contribute to self-sustained changes in Antarctic
sea ice. The main tool for this investigation will be the CNRM Climate Model, which will be
used to perform dedicated simulations and sensitivity studies.

The main objectives of the project (can be adjusted with the successful candidate):

1. Evaluate the CNRM Climate Model in modelling pre-industrial and contemporary
Antarctic sea ice extent and seasonal cycle. The first objective is to evaluate and
tune the CNRM Climate Model to best represent sea ice (in preparation for this
project and for CMIP7).

2. Investigate the probability and drivers of the abrupt decline in antarctic sea ice in
Antarctica using preindustrial and historical simulations. Examine the potential role of
internal climate variability versus forced change in driving abrupt changes in sea-ice
cover, similar as observed in the past decade.

3. Examine the Role of Oceanic Heat Transport and Sea Ice Feedbacks in sustaining a
low or a high sea-ice state once an abrupt change is generated.

Required/Desired Skills:

We are seeking a highly motivated candidate with the following background:

● PhD in climate science, physical oceanography, atmospheric science, or a related field.

● Experience in climate modeling and, ideally, in model development

● Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, Fortran, R) for data analysis and simulation handling.

● Knowledge of polar climate systems, oceanography, sea ice dynamics

Research Environment:

The postdoc will be recruited by Sorbonne Université (Paris) and be based at CNRM (Centre
National de Recherches Météorologiques), part of Météo-France, in Toulouse, France.
CNRM is a leading climate and weather research institute with cutting-edge computational
resources and a vibrant scientific community, offering an excellent environment for
collaboration and interdisciplinary research. The successful applicant will join, and active and
dynamic group of scientists, and early career scientist working in related fields.
