Applications are invited for the post of Researcher in Physical Oceanography to undertake research into ocean processes in the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica.  You will work with Professor Karen Heywood and Dr Rob Hall on the ERC-funded COMPASS project and the NSF-NERC-funded TARSAN project, a joint project between oceanographers and glaciologists to understand the behaviours of ice shelves, as part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC).

You will investigate the oceanographic drivers of the basal melting of the Thwaites, Dotson and Getz ice shelves in the southern Amundsen Sea. Depending on your research interests, your analyses might exploit any or all of the following unique and exciting data sets collected during COMPASS and TARSAN:
   -  Surveys of hydrographic properties, current velocity and turbulent mixing obtained under Dotson ice shelf from Autosub Long Range.
   -  Ocean glider and ship-based hydrographic surveys across the Amundsen Sea and in front of Dotson and Getz ice shelves.
   -  Moored time series beneath Thwaites ice shelf and in the Amundsen Sea.
   -  Three years of seasonal hydrography from tagged seals in the Amundsen Sea.

        
You will collaborate with TARSAN and COMPASS colleagues in various US and UK institutions, and the University of Gothenburg. You will also collaborate with a biogeochemical counterpart to TARSAN, the ARTEMIS project. These international collaborations, together with the networking and early career scientist support provided by ITGC, offer an excellent opportunity to further develop your career. Although the data collection phases of TARSAN and COMPASS are now nearing completion, you will have the option to join UEAâ€™s ocean glider group and gain skills in operating and piloting the UEA Seaglider fleet.

You should have, or soon to be awarded, a PhD in physical oceanography (or equivalent independent research experience) and have led publications in scientific journals. You should have excellent communication skills and have presented results at conferences. 

This full-time post is available from 1 May 2023 or as soon as possible thereafter, for a fixed term period up to 32 months, must end 31 December 2025.
