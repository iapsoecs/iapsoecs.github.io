JOB SUMMARY

The coastal biogeochemical dynamics lab in the Department of the Marine Sciences located on the Avery Point campus at the University of Connecticut invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Associate. The successful candidate will advance our understanding of the predictability of oxygen and temperature globally as a participant in a NOAA-funded project about forecasting metabolic indices in the global ocean on decadal timescales. Our project objective is to examine the predictability of fisheries-relevant environmental variables beyond sea surface temperature and chlorophyll, such as oxygen and related metabolic metrics, as well as potential limitations on fisheries that this metabolic index projects in Earth system models (ESMs).

This position will provide an opportunity to advance the understanding of the controls over regionally predictability of biogeochemical fields, and explore decadal prediction capabilities of ESMs as well as their application to fisheries management. The position will also enable the postdoctoral scholar the opportunity to collaborate with the NOAA MAPP Task force associated with the project funding as well as two other closely related projects led by Matt Long and Colleen Petrik pertaining to modeling feedbacks between fish and biogeochemistry in ESMs.

The successful candidate will have a working knowledge of ocean biogeochemical cycling including carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycles in the context of large-scale ocean circulation, expertise in programming and large data set analysis, and model evaluation. Preference will be given to candidates with experience with large biogeochemical observational data sets like ARGO.  The position will be located at the regional campus at Avery Point working predominately with the laboratory of Samantha Siedlecki, with opportunities to travel to NCAR in Boulder, Colorado to work with Matt Long, a co-PI on the project.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

  *   Analyze model output and evaluate model performance using existing observational data;
  *   Quantify regional predictability of model fields on decadal timescales
  *   Publish research in peer-reviewed journals and present results at national and international conferences.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

  *   Doctoral degree in Oceanography, or a closely related field
  *   Technical training or practical experience in programming (Python, Matlab or similar)
  *   Understanding of ocean biogeochemical cycling including carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycles in the context of large-scale ocean circulation
  *   Experience with biogeochemical model analysis and evaluation or large observational data set equivalent
  *   Ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment
  *   Excellent written and oral communication skills
  *   Publications related to the minimum qualifications
  *   Ability to pursue research independently

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS

  *   Experience with large biogeochemical observational data sets like oxygen from ARGO
  *   Demonstrated experience mentoring graduate or undergraduate students
  *   Ability to travel to NCAR

APPOINTMENT TERMS

The initial appointment is for one year, with the possibility of renewal.  Salary and benefits are competitive.
