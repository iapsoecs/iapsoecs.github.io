UCLA is seeking a postdoctoral researcher with expertise in ocean modeling to join a project aimed at investigating physical-biogeochemical interactions along the U.S. West Coast and in the Pacific Ocean. The successful candidate will join J. McWilliams and D. Bianchiâ€™s groups at University of California Los Angeles, and work on development and application of Regional Earth System Models to a wide range of questions in physics, biogeochemistry and ecosystem. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences or a related field, effective oral and written communication skills, and familiarity with numerical ocean circulation/biogeochemical models. Experience with ROMS or similar models, Matlab/Python is strongly encouraged.
