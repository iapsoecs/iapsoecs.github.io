The Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for the Weather of the 21st Century is a major seven-year partnership between Monash University, The University of Melbourne, Australian National University, University of New South Wales and the University of Tasmania. We additionally work with a suite of global partner organisations spanning research, government and industry. 


We research how Australia’s weather is being reshaped by climate change. Our Research Program is comprised of six interconnected Centre Projects: Weather System Dynamics; Climate Variability and Weather Systems; Weather Systemes in a Warmer World; Weather Resources; High Impact Weather; Modelling Science. 

 

We have commenced our search for ~20 postdoctoral research associates/fellows across our five universities. Working in a Centre of Excellence is unlike any other postdoctoral opportunity. You will be supported to work collaboratively across institutions and disciplines with an extensive program of professional development opportunities.  

 

Details of currently open positions and how to apply can be found on the positions vacant page on the Centre’s Website: https://21centuryweather.org.au/about-us/positions-vacant/. Positions will be progressively advertised in early – mid 2024 at each of our universities and added to this webpage.
