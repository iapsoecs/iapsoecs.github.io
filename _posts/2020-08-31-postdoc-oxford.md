3-year postdoc in ocean modelling at University of Oxford, part of the SNAP-DRAGON project (Subpolar North Atlantic Processes - Dynamics and pRedictability of vAriability in Gyre and OverturNing)

We are looking for a postdoctoral research assistant to carry out and interpret high-resolution numerical model sensitivity experiments of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean. The postholder will work closely with UK and US researchers within the NERC-NSF funded SNAP-DRAGON project to determine the causes of subpolar ocean variability.

The subpolar North Atlantic Ocean occupies a key role in regional and global climate, yet is poorly represented in climate models, which limits our confidence in predictions. SNAP-DRAGON will bring recent OSNAP and other observations together with numerical models in a range of innovative ways to produce a step change in our understanding of the causes of subpolar ocean variability.
The successful candidate for this particular post will be responsible for setting up, running and analysing the results of high-resolution numerical model simulations using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm).
