The Bracco's Ocean and Climate Group at Georgia Tech is looking for two postdoctoral fellows!

We have two interdisciplinary research projects focused on connectivity of mesophotic coral populations in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico, and on high-resolution regional modeling to understand acoustic propagation around seamounts in the North Atlantic.
We are looking for postdocs that would like to be engaged with them and have interests in modeling ocean connectivity to understand coral resilience for the first project and in physical oceanography and sound propagation in presence of mesoscale and submesoscale variability in the second case.
Both projects are part of collaborative efforts with scientists at LeHigh University, NOAA and the Smithsonian for the first, and scientists at Georgia Tech, WHOI, Scripps among other institutions for the second.

For both positions, experience with regional ocean modeling and large-data analysis would be prioritized. Some knowledge of machine learning tools would be valuable.

I would like to identify a suitable candidate as soon as possible with a start date in early 2023.

I would appreciate your help in disseminating this email and I will continue reviewing applications until the positions are filled.
