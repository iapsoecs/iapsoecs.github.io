## Job Description Summary:
The CGD Laboratory at NSF’s National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is seeking a Project Scientist I to join our Oceanography Section. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge Earth system science and help guide the development of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), with a focus on its ocean component, the Modular Ocean Model version 6 (MOM6).

In this role, you will combine scientific research with community coordination, serving as the science liaison for the CESM Ocean Model Working Group (OMWG). You'll collaborate closely with scientists across NSF NCAR and the broader university community to advance CESM’s ocean modeling capabilities and ensure effective integration with other CESM components.

We’re looking for a scientist who is passionate about improving ocean models and fostering the scientific community. You’ll have the opportunity to:

- Lead and contribute to research that enhances the CESM ocean model;
- Coordinate OMWG activities and foster collaboration across working groups;
- Support broader CESM ocean-related projects that inform Earth system science at NSF NCAR, and beyond.

If you're eager to make a scientific impact while engaging with a vibrant community of Earth system modelers, we encourage you to apply.
