We have an open position for a fully funded PhD Fellow (3 years, fulltime)
at the Meteorology department at the university of Bonn starting in the
beginning of 2023. This project involves the investigation of gas (mainly
carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between the atmosphere and the oceans. The
focus will be on coastal areas, which feature higher variability than the
open ocean. During the project, direct measurements of the gas exchange and
oceanic turbulence will allow to gain understanding on the driving exchange
processes.

Applicants should send a CV, detailed cover letter highlighting their
interest in this position, and the names and contact information of
potential referees to lesters@uni-bonn.de.

Closing data: 15.11.2022
