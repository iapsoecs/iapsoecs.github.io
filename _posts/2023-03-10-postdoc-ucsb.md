A Postdoctoral researcher is sought to collaborate on simulating the effect
of midlatitude air-sea interactions on the properties of Pacific decadal
climate variability (PDV). This is part of a multi-institutional
collaborative research project with PIs at UCSB, Brown University, and the
University of Colorado, with a focus on improving understanding of
high-resolution Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) dynamics and its
contribution to PDV in coupled climate models. The Postdoctoral scholar
will have primary responsibility for the generation and analysis of new
simulations with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) in the
variable-resolution configuration, to isolate the role of increased
resolution in the KOE region in affecting both PDV and precipitation in
western North America. The Postdoc scholar will work closely with Dr.
Samatha Stevenson-Michener. They will also lead research in the atmosphere
and climate dynamics responsible for these effects, in collaboration with
other project team members. More information on this project can be found
here: www.pdv-tools.org

This is a full-time position. Competitive salary and benefits commensurate
with experience. The initial appointment is for 2 years with the potential
for an additional year based on satisfactory performance and funding
availability.

The University is especially interested in candidates who can contribute to
the diversity and excellence of the academic community through research,
teaching, and service as appropriate to the position.
