This Associate Scientist position is to address research questions that would create better predictions of sea-level rise by improving our understanding of ice sheet flow, and the response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to the Earth's climate evolution. The work will be conducted collaboratively with researchers of the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The incumbent will formulate novel research hypothesis to reduce uncertainties in sea-level rise projections. Hypothesis will be tested with state-of-the-art simulations and against remote sensing observations (e.g., airborne and spaceborne laser altimeters). This position is to utilize the sophisticated, NASA-funded and open-source, Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), and work on experiment design, model calibration, execution, data assimilation, and data analysis. Expertise with ISSM is thus required. Working knowledge of remote sensing observations relevant for either data assimilation or val
 idation is also needed. Therefore, we seek an enthusiastic candidate with a suitable PhD degree (in physics, remote sensing, atmospheric sciences, or mathematics), equipped with proficient programming skills, and demonstrated ability to present and to publish research findings in conferences and through peer-reviewed journal articles to advance the field.


Essential Duties/Responsibilities:

  *   Carry out research on ice sheet contribution to sea-level rise
  *   Investigate ice dynamic response to climate evolution
  *   Perform sophisticated simulations and data assimilation experiments with ISSM
  *   Analyze ice sheet mass change projection
  *   Participate in scientific meetings, and engage with colleagues and collaborators pursuing related research questions

Required Qualifications:
Education:

  *   Ph.D. in Planetary Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, or a related field

Experience:

  *   0-5 years' experience in related field
  *   Experience with ice sheet modeling and data assimilation
  *   Experience with airborne and spaceborne altimetry
  *   Must have presented and published in peer-reviewed journal articles fine research results that have advanced the field

Knowledge, Skills & Abilities:

  *   Excellent practical knowledge of working with modeling and satellite datasets
  *   State-of-the-art methods for statistical analysis design and interpretation
  *   Outstanding programming skills (e.g., Matlab, Python, Fortran, C)
  *   Ability to use high-performance computing system and multiprocessor environments
  *   Demonstrated scientific communication abilities
  *   Must have presented and published in peer-reviewed journal articles fine research results that have advanced the field.

Working Conditions:

Work will be performed in an office or computer lab environment. While performing the duties of this job, the employee is frequently required to stand; walk; sit; talk or hear. Keyboarding for large time spans each day may be a significant part of this position.

Travel:

Negligible
