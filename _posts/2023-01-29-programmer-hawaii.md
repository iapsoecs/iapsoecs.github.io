The Currents group at the University of Hawaii serves the US
oceanographic research community by providing software and advice for
ocean current measurements, primarily using shipboard acoustic Doppler
current profilers. We are looking for someone who enjoys working in
Python on Open Source software, visualizing ocean current structures,
contributing to the nation's oceanographic research enterprise, and
interacting with technicians and scientists throughout the country.
Strong experience in scientific Python programming is desirable.
