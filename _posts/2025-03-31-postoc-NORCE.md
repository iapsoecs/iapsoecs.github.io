We are excited to announce that we are hiring a paleo climate modeller! 
 
This postdoctoral researcher position is for a fixed time of 3 years, based in Bergen (Norway). 
The focus is on investigating the Arctic region during past warm climates using NorESM.
The position is part of the ERC Synergy Grant i2B - Into The Blue, a research collaboration between UiT and NORCE/UiB (in Norway) and AWI (in Germany).

## About the position

The overall aim of this postdoctoral project is to investigate the Arctic region during past warm climates, such as the Last Interglacial, mid-Pliocene and/or Miocene. We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher with a keen interest in setting up, running and analyzing Earth System Model simulations, focused on ocean - ice processes. The successful candidate is expected to contribute to and work with the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), as well as to analyze already existing simulations from other ESMs, for example, through PMIP (Paleo Model Intercomparison Project). The work will be in collaboration with ice sheet modellers, paleoceanographers and ecosystem experts already working in i2B at NORCE. We also expect the successful candidate to contribute to outreach activities of i2B, and to publish results in high-level peer-reviewed journals.
 
The i2B Into The Blue project (ERC Synergy Grant)
The position is part of the European Research Council Synergy Grant "i2B - Into The Blue", which fosters collaboration between The Arctic University of Troms√∏ (UiT, Norway), NORCE in Bergen (Norway), and The Alfred Wegener Institute - Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven (Germany). i2B is funded for 6 years (started in November 2024) and aims to fill a major research gap in Arctic science by investigating processes, consequences and impacts of past "greenhouse" (warmer than present) conditions. In i2B we will retrieve new, key Arctic geological archives of past warmth and employ climate models to bring our current knowledge about a warm Arctic beyond the state-of-the-art. The major strengths and aims of i2B are the expertise, knowledge, skills and planned synergies of our Arctic paleoclimate data and modelling teams at UiT, NORCE and AWI.
