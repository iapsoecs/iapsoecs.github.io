The High Meadows Environmental Institute at Princeton University is seeking a Postdoctoral fellow or more senior researcher in the area of ocean biophysical modeling to work with Professors Laure Resplandy and Bess Ward. The researcher will investigate the impact of climate variability and human factors on nitrous oxide production in the Indian Ocean. The researcher will specifically evaluate the drivers of nitrous oxide production and spatio-temporal variability (including the response to anthropogenic factors) using a regional ocean bio-physical model and available observations.

The ideal candidate will have a background in ocean modeling, but candidates with the necessary background in ocean biogeochemistry and/or geophysical fluid dynamics will be given full consideration. A Ph.D. in Geosciences or related field is required. Postdoctoral appointments are initially for one year with the renewal for subsequent years based on satisfactory performance and continued funding. A competitive salary is offered commensurate with experience and qualifications.
Applicants are asked to submit a cover letter, vitae, a publication list, a statement of research experience and interests, and names of at least 3 references. Applicants should apply online to https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/29101. Review of applications will begin as soon as they are received and continue until the position is filled.
