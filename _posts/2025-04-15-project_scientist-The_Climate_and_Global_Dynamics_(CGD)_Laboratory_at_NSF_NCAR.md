NSF NCAR’s Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD) Laboratory is excited to announce the opening of a Project Scientist I position in the Oceanography Section. This position will support the development, evaluation, and scientific use of the Modular Ocean Model version 6 (MOM6) coupled to the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A). The incumbent will lead efforts to develop and validate high-resolution (1/12° and finer) global ocean-atmosphere coupled simulations, the development of post-processing and analysis tools, and collaborate with researchers across CGD and the Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology (MMM) Laboratory. There may also be opportunities to contribute to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and regional modeling efforts using MOM6. This position blends collaborative and independent research with community-facing scientific development at the forefront of high-resolution Earth system modeling.

This position is part of NSF NCAR’s Strategic Hiring Initiative for NSF NCAR Excellence (SHINE), a program designed to build capacity for interdisciplinary research, cultivate new leadership in Earth system science, and advance the center’s strategic priorities.
