We seek a talented post-doctoral scientist to carry out research to better understand how the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has changed in the past, and how it may change in the future. This research is an important component of a recently funded international research project, EPOC (https://www.epoc-eu.org/), which is a collaboration between 21 institutions across Europe, the US, and Canada.

To better understand past changes in AMOC you will assess indirect observations (or proxies) of the AMOC using a range of state-of-the-art coupled climate models. This work will feed into a critical reassessment of past AMOC changes. You will also explore how model resolution affects the simulation of the AMOC, including the sensitivity of the AMOC and its climate impacts to anthropogenic forcing.

Fixed term contract for 33 months with the possibility of extending this up to 41 months subject to funding.

You will have:

- A PhD or equivalent in mathematical or physical science, or should expect to shortly receive one
- Strong scientific analytical ability, creativity, and self-motivation
- Experience of analysing output from climate models or similar datasets
- Good communication skills and the disposition to collaborate effectively with both internal and external project members
