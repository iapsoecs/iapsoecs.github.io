Postdoctoral Associate position in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The successful applicant will work with Assistant Professor Abigail Bodner and in collaboration with Oceananigans developers at MIT, leveraging state of the art GPU-based high-resolution simulations to address fundamental open-questions on multiscale upper ocean dynamics. The project will involve running and analyzing the Oceananigans large eddy simulation, resolving scales ranging from 100km down to single meters, and applying theoretical and machine learning approaches to develop new parameterizations for General Circulation Models.

Job Requirements: PhD in geosciences, statistics, physics, engineering, or a related field at the time of the appointment. Strong background in fluid dynamics, turbulence, and/or oceanography preferred. Experience working with numerical simulations, scientific programming, and/or machine learning is an advantage.

Application instructions: please apply online via https://hr.mit.edu/careers (job ID #23637) applicants are asked to send a CV, a brief statement of research interests, and the names of three references to abodner@mit.edu<mailto:abodner@mit.edu> with postdoc job in the subject.
