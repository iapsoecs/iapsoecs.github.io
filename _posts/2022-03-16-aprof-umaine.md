Location:
Orono ME

Statement of the Job:

The University of Maine’s School of Marine Sciences seeks to fill the full-time, academic-year, tenure-track position of Assistant Professor of Oceanography to begin August 29, 2022.  We are seeking a physical oceanographer with research interests and expertise in the area of ocean observing, especially in, but not limited to, the Gulf of Maine and adjacent waters.  This region has attracted much attention from scientists and marine resource managers in light of recent, rapid changes in water properties driven in large part by variable water mass dynamics in the area.  The successful candidate will have the opportunity to take advantage of the infrastructure currently available as part of the University of Maine’s Ocean Observing program, which includes several faculty currently funded in part by IOOS/ NOAA via NERACOOS (Northeast Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems) and CariCOOS (Caribbean Integrated Coastal Ocean Observing System).

The School of Marine Sciences has approximately 360 undergraduate majors, 75 graduate students and 24 full time faculty, and offers graduate and undergraduate degrees.  Graduate programs include:  M.S. and Ph.D programs in Marine Biology; M.S. and Ph.D. programs in Oceanography; M.S. program in Marine Policy, and a non-thesis Professional Marine Science (P.S.M.) degree.  We also offer a dual M.S. degree program in Marine Policy coupled with either Marine Biology or Oceanography. Our SMS faculty participate in the interdepartmental graduate program in Aquaculture.  Our undergraduate program offers a B.S. degree in Marine Science that can be either a stand-alone Marine Science degree, or it can have an area of concentration, in either Marine Biology, Oceanography or Aquaculture. 

The successful candidate will:

    Have a workload split of 50% Teaching, 50% Research.  The College defines a full teaching load (100%), as 18 credit hours (per year).
    Advise and mentor undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral associates.
    Engage in institutional and professional service.
    Develop and maintain an active, extramurally-funded research program in the general area of physical oceanography and ocean observing.
    Teach classes at the undergraduate and graduate level.
    Promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the institution and discipline.
