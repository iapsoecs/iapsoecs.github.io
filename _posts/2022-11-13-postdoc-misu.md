We are pleased to announce a full time 3-year postdoc position, with application deadline 15 January, 2023, to model and investigate causes behind major changes in ocean circulation and climate of the last 300 million years (see details in official  job-link below or contract me). The position is open at Stockholm University Bolin Centre for Climate Research and the Department of Geological Sciences. The successful candidate will be working in my group, which specializes in ocean dynamics and its role in climate change in the geological past, present, and future. Our group collaborates closely with in-house paleoclimate proxy experts to provide the anchoring in observations.

We are looking for applicants with a strong interest in ocean and/or climate dynamics and modelling, and a holistic view of the climate system. The candidate must hold a relevant doctorate degree that has been completed at latest before the employment decision is made, but no more than three years before the closing date (except for special circumstances such as parental leave.)

The postdoc is for 3 years and there are good prospects to continue employment a 4th year through an alternative research position.
