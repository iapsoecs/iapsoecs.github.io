**Postdoctoral Researcher in Plankton Imaging and Ocean Biogeochemical Modeling**

The Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University, in association with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), seeks a postdoctoral or more senior scientist to work in the area of plankton imaging and ocean biogeochemistry.

The rise of ocean optical technologies has yielded a diversity of underwater imagers and microscopes (e.g. the Imaging Flow Cytobot, the Underwater Vision Profiler and the In situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System), sampling plankton and detritus ranging multiple orders of magnitude in size. Broad deployment of these samplers have yielded datasets spanning the global oceans, yet few efforts have been made to bring these datasets together to evaluate and improve models. In collaboration with the Laboratoire d'Oceanographie de Villefranche (LOV) of Sorbonne University and the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), GFDL/Princeton is initiating a project to compile a global dataset of plankton and particle size structure, examine the biogeography of plankton/particle traits, and improve model-data intercomparisons for Earth System Models (ESMs).

We seek a postdoctoral researcher to work at the interface between marine ecosystem observations and modeling. The ideal candidate would have a strong background in ocean observations or plankton imaging, with experience or interest in marine ecosystem modeling. We seek an individual proficient in scientific computing (e.g. Python, git, shell scripting) and strong communication and project management skills. The individual will work with another postdoctoral researcher within the Computational Plankton Ecology team at LOV and associated scientists, and will join an active group at Princeton and GFDL studying the connections between biogeochemistry, ecosystems, and climate.

A Ph.D is required in either oceanography, marine ecology, biogeochemistry, or related field. Initial appointment is for one year with the possibility of renewal for a second year subject to satisfactory performance.

Complete applications, including a CV with a list of publications, a statement of research interests (no more than 2 pages including references), and contact information of 3 references should be submitted by July 30, 2021 11:59 EST for full consideration. Princeton is interested in candidates who, through their research, will contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community.  Applicants should apply online https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/20841.
