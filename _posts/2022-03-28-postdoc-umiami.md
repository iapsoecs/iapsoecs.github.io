1-year postdoc (PDRA) renewable for a second year in observational physical
oceanography in the subtropical North Atlantic (RAPID/MOCHA 26ÂºN).  Post is
located in Miami, Florida at the University of Miami (adjacent to NOAA
Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory).

The Department of Ocean Sciences of the University of Miami, Rosenstiel
School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS), invites applications for
a *Postdoctoral Associate position in Physical Oceanography*. We seek a
postdoctoral associate to join our group to work on the Meridional
Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array project (
https://mocha.rsmas.miami.edu/mocha/). MOCHA is a collaborative project,
partnered with the Rapid UK Program (https://rapid.ac.uk/rapidmoc/) and the
NOAA AOML Western Boundary Time Series project, to measure the Atlantic
meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and meridional heat transport
(MHT) in the North Atlantic. As the Rapid-MOCHA array is approaching its
20th anniversary, we are seeking a researcher especially interested in
studying the joint dynamics of the MHT and AMOC and their roles on
interannual ocean heat content and regional and global climate processes.
The primary tools to achieve this goal will be analyses of Rapid-MOCHA data
and other ancillary data sets and models. The incumbent will also
participate in a research cruise planned in early 2023 and be involved in
data collection activities related to the program.

The successful candidate will participate in scientific discussions among
the Rapid-MOCHA international team, present findings at scientific
meetings, and publish results in scientific journals.  Applications are now
being accepted and the position is expected to be filled as soon as
possible. For further questions about the position, candidates may inquire
directly to Prof. Shane Elipot (selipot@rsmas.miami.edu) and Prof. William
Johns (bjohns@rsmas.miami.edu).
