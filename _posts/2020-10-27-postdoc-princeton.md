**Postdoctoral position in fluid dynamics**

The laboratory of Professor Ching-Yao Lai in the program of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) and Geoscience (GEO) at Princeton University invites applications in the broad areas of fluid dynamics and geophysics for a postdoctoral position starting March 2021 or later. A Ph.D. in physical sciences, engineering, applied mathematics, or a related field is required prior to starting. We are looking for candidates with a keen interest in fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamics, interfacial phenomena, ice dynamics, climate science, or fluid-structure interactions. Research experience in mathematical modeling, numerical methods or machine learning is preferred. Our group aims to combine mathematical models (analytical or computational) and machine-learning algorithms to address the environmental and climate challenges facing society, such as predicting the future of ice dynamics in a warming climate and improving its physical representation in climate models. Appointments are for one year, renewable annually based on satisfactory performance and available funding. See our group website for more info about our research: cylai.princeton.edu<http://cylai.princeton.edu/>

The Princeton AOS program emphasizes theoretical studies and numerical model studies of the global climate system, and applicants are expected to have a strong background in natural sciences and mathematics. The AOS program benefits from the research capabilities of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Many GFDL climate modelers are active in the AOS program as lecturers and broadly collaborate with AOS students and postdocs.

Applicants must apply online (https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/18221) by February 1, 2020, 11:59 EST. Submit a cover letter, CV, one or more first-author publications, contact information for at least three references, and a 1-2 page research statement including previous research accomplishments and current interests.

This position is subject to Princeton University?s background check policy.

Princeton University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
