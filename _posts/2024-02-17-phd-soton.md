A new PhD project has been advertised at the University of Southampton relating changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation with flooding for UK Nuclear Sites.

 

This project will be based at the University of Southampton with partners from the National Oceanography Centre and EDF Energy: https://noc.ac.uk/gsnocs/project/impact-atlantic-meridional-overturning-circulation-flooding-nuclear-sites-uk.

 

The student will become part of a new Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) for Resilient Flood Futures that has been set up in the UK. The PhD candidates from this CDT will be the next generation of research practitioners, who can connect timely research questions with key sector needs and policy changes.

 

We are now accepting PhD student applications to begin in October 2024.  For questions, please contact the lead supervisor k.gunn@soton.ac.uk.
