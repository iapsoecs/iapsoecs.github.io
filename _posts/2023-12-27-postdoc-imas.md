The Institute of Marine and Antarctic Science (IMAS) at the University of Tasmania is hiring a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biogeochemical Modelling to contribute to the research project 'Constraining the additionality problem for Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE)'. The aim of this project is to enable the quantification of additionality during large-scale OAE simulations by making experimentally-informed improvements to Australia?s Earth System Model, ACCESS-OM3. Specifically, this position will work to incorporate mechanisms that may lead to a reduction in CaCO3 dissolution in coastal sediments and/or open ocean corrosive microenvironments. The position has a strong team focus and will collaborate across an exciting nexus of emerging research into marine carbon dioxide removal based in Hobart.
