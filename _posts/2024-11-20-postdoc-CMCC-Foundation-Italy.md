## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
We are seeking two talented, motivated, and proactive Ocean Modellers with a passion for marine science to join our dynamic team at the Institute for Earth System Predictions (IESP). The successful candidates will be part of the Global Coastal Ocean division, contributing to innovative research within the framework of the  FOCCUS, EDITO and  PHAROS projects. This role is ideal for candidates with strong knowledge of ocean circulation and wave modelling, eager to advance their career in marine science through cutting-edge research at global and coastal scales. A key objective of this position is the contribution to the development of a digital twin of the coastal ocean, a critical tool in advancing predictive models for climate adaptation and ocean management.
If you are ready to join a forward-looking team, contribute to the development of a coastal ocean digital twin, and make significant advancements in global coastal circulation and wave modelling, apply today to be part of our journey toward improving ocean predictions and climate adaptation strategies!

## ABOUT US
CMCC Foundation is a cross-cutting scientific research centre on climate change and its interactions with the environment, society, the world of business, and policymakers. Our work aims to stimulate sustainable growth, protect the environment, and develop strategies for the adaptation and mitigation of climate change. CMCC's core objective is to conduct cutting-edge science, to train the next generation of scientists at both national and international levels, and to be a beacon for climate modelling.

## ROLE AND RESPONSABILITIES
The selected candidates will engage in ocean modelling research and forecasting activities, emphasizing the link between global and coastal processes in a seamless continuum approach. As an integral part of our team, this position will involve:

    Developing and implementing circulation and wave spectral models, especially for high-resolution modelling on unstructured grids, using downscaling approach.
    Conducting research on coastal and ocean processes, with a particular focus on extreme events and their mitigation and adaptation strategies in response to climate change.
    Building and calibrating the digital twin of the coastal ocean by integrating observational datasets, enhancing the physical complexity of our coupled numerical models, and studying related interactions.
    Focusing on short-term forecasting and hindcast modelling with both deterministic and ensemble approaches.
    Processing and interpreting data from simulations and observations, supporting advancements in coastal modelling and forecasting applications.


## REQUIREMENTS
Ideal candidates will possess a strong background in ocean circulation and wave modelling, with high proficiency in computational techniques and numerical modelling.
Key requirements include:

PhD or equivalent experience in Physical Oceanography, Coastal Engineering, Computational Fluid Dynamics, or related scientific fields focused on numerical modelling (e.g., Physics, Mathematics).
Experience in the development and implementation of ocean models, with a solid understanding of coastal processes and high-resolution modelling techniques, preferably using unstructured grids and nesting.
Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Fortran, or C, with familiarity in UNIX/Linux environments and scripting languages (*nix shell).
Knowledge of HPC architectures and parallel programming.
Fluency in English, with strong communication skills for collaboration within a multidisciplinary team.

Additional experience with ensemble forecasting and sediment transport models is advantageous and will be positively evaluated


## DURATION, COMPENSATION & BENEFITS
Please note that this opportunity will be issued both internally and externally.
The Researcher will be based in Lecce CMCC office.
The appointment period will be initially of 24 months, starting from January 2025, renewable for 24 months additional months pending a positive evaluation. Tenure can be granted from 2 to 4 years after being appointed as a junior researcher.
Contract and gross annual salary will be based on qualifications and working experience.
Welfare package
Flexible working time
Support during the immigration process, if needed
