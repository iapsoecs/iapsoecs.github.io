Research Scientist in Dynamical Oceanography and Ocean Remote Sensing (OK Energy Project) at Institt für Meereskunde Universität Hamburg, Germany

I would like to draw your attention to the following announcement of a postdoc position at the Institute für Meereskunde, Department of Earth System Sciences, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences, Universität Hamburg

We are seeking to employ a talented researcher to analyze novel SWOT altimeter data to gain insight into small-scale ocean dynamics and turbulence covering global and regional ocean flow aspects. To this extent SWOT data will be analyzed with respect to their sub-mesoscale eddy content and will be used to constrain a high-resolution ocean circulation model through data assimilation. The successful candidate will use the data insight and the output of the model to improve our understanding of sub-mesoscale ocean dynamics.

You will join an international team at Universität Hamburg. You will be responsible for analyzing altimeter data and for performing modeling and assimilation efforts and for publishing the results.

You will have or shortly be expected to achieve:
- A PhD or equivalent in oceanography, meteorology or physical sciences
- Experience of analyzing remote senssing data or running climate models with or without data assimialtion
- Strong scientific computing skills
- An understanding of dynamical ocean processes.
