Dear Colleagues,

Shom (French National Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service) is seeking applications for a Research Engineer position specializing in statistics of extreme weather and ocean events, based in Toulouse, France.

Mission:

The successful candidate will join the marine submersion team (approximately 6 people) within the "Physical Oceanography Research" department. The primary focus will be on characterizing extreme sea levels and associated chronologies for use in coastal marine submersion numerical simulation tools. Key responsibilities :

* Develop expertise in state-of-the-art tools for extreme value analysis,
* Propose and implement methodologies for characterizing extrema of various geophysical quantities (extreme levels, water level and surge, significant wave heights, currents, temperature, salinity, etc.),
* Contribute to the development of the next generation of "extreme levels" products,
* Project future extreme water levels in the context of climate change.

Qualifications:

You have a minimum level of studies of 5 years (Engineer, Master 2, or PhD) in statistics and scientific computing, and preliminary experience in at least two of the following areas :

* Statistical methods for characterizing rare events,
* Code development and statistical applications,
* Scientific computing for data processing,
* Physical oceanography.

Required skills:

* Proficiency in computing tools and programming languages   (e.g. R, Matlab, python, fortran...),
* Strong teamwork skills in a multidisciplinary context,
* Expertise in time series and/or geospatial data processing,
* Knowledge of numerical modeling for physical process simulation,
* Understanding of oceanography and geophysics,
* Autonomy, rigor, organizational skills, and initiative,
* Professional English skills for international communication.

 
Interested candidates should submit a cover letter and curriculum vitae to recrutement@shom.fr by March 27, 2025, with the reference `STATS_METEO_OCEANO`.
