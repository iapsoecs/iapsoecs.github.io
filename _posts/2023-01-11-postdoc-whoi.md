Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is currently searching for a Postdoctoral Investigator to join the Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department. This is a regular, full-time, exempt position, and is eligible for benefits. The initial appointment will be for one year with the possibility of a one-year extension.

Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Investigator position in in-situ sensor engineering and development with a focus on coastal biogeochemical cycling and turbulent transport. The successful candidate will contribute to the development of a variety of new technological advancements for the measurement and analysis of pelagic and benthic fluxes and coastal "blue carbon" cycling. Additional opportunities also include the development of a coastal sonar mapping AUV and the advancement of green energy and communication platforms for long-term marine ecosystem monitoring. There are opportunities for both field and lab/engineering work in Massachusetts and opportunities to go to sea.

The institution has a top-rated postdoctoral program (www.whoi.edu/postdoctoral/) that supports a dynamic postdoctoral community with formal mentoring and career guidance programs. While the primary focus of the work will be in research, the Postdoctoral Investigator will have the opportunity to participate in educational and outreach activities associated with the project.

Essential Functions

  *   Contribute to the electrical, mechanical, and scientific development of new technological advancements for the measurement and analysis of pelagic and benthic fluxes and coastal "blue carbon" cycling.
  *   Contribute to the analyses of existing and new datasets and publication in scientific journals.
  *   Depending on the successful candidates' interests and abilities, essential functions may include:
     *   AUV development and operation,
     *   electrical engineering,
     *   3D printing,
     *   CAD design,
     *   scientific diving,
     *   programming
Education & Experience

  *   Ph.D. in Oceanography, Engineering, Ecology, or a related discipline.
  *   Preferred candidates should have strong quantitative skills and interdisciplinary expertise in some of the following fields (in no particular order): (1) marine chemistry and benthic biogeochemical cycling, (2) time series and large observational dataset analysis, including a complementary skillset (e.g., programming experience or strong mathematical/statistical training), (3) fluid mechanics and turbulent transport techniques, (4) chemical sensor and acoustics instrumentation, or (5) electrical or mechanical engineering and programming.
Applications must be submitted through WHOI's Human Resources' website (https://careers-whoi.icims.com/jobs/1935/postdoctoral-investigator/job).  Applications should include a cover letter, complete curriculum vitae, and the names of at three individuals will to write a letter of recommendation for the candidate. Applications will be reviewed starting January 15, 2023 and until the position is filled.  The position can start immediately. Interested applicants can contact Dr. Matthew Long (mlong@whoi.edu).
