Sciences at SIO is here:

and here:

<https://apol-recruit.ucsd.edu/JPF02672>


This ad is part of a UC San Diego cluster hire, and SIO faculty recruited
through this initiative will be linked to African American and Black
Diaspora studies through innovative research, coordinated teaching and
mentoring, and targeted service. Research programs that are particularly
relevant to this search could be centered on global change, climate change,
and natural and environmental hazards and the impact of these processes on
vulnerable African American and Black Diaspora communities.


This position will continue SIO's commitment to research at the
intersection between natural science and society with an emphasis on the
scientific foundations of environmental justice studies. One example of an
effort at SIO connecting basic science to society is within the Scripps
Polar Center <http://polar.ucsd.edu>, there are other listed in the ad.


The closing date for applications is March 31, 2021.
