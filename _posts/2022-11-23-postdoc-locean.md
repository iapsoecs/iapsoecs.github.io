**Human influence on global ocean ventilation**

The World Ocean has crucial climatic and life-supporting roles. We know that these roles
depend critically on the “ventilation” of the deep ocean, i.e., the transport of tracers (heat,
carbon, oxygen, nutrients) between the surface and the deep seas. However, too little is
known about the processes shaping deep-ocean ventilation and its changes.
The Southern Ocean is thought to have an outsized role in connecting surface and deep
waters: about 60% of the total global ocean volume had its last surface contact or will have
its next surface contact south of 40oS (de Vries and Primeau, 2011). A key unknown of the
ventilation puzzle concerns the return path from the interior ocean to the Southern Ocean
surface, which involves wind-driven vertical circulation as well as mixing processes, and
which controls the rate at which the large carbon and nutrient deep-ocean reservoirs
communicate with the surface (e.g. Le Queré 2009; de Vries 2017). The central objective of
the project is to understand the drivers of this return path from the global deep ocean to the
Southern Ocean surface, and their ability to change under on-going climate change.

Ocean ventilation can occur either through advection of material as part of the global ocean
overturning circulation, or through diffusive mixing. While the resurfacing of deep waters in
the Southern Ocean has been described as primarily driven by winds (Marshall and Speer,
2012), the local and large-scale impacts of interior mixing hotspots remain unclear. The first
objective of this project will be to quantify the impact of varying interior mixing intensity
versus winds on the resurfacing of deep waters in the Southern Ocean. This will be
addressed by sensitivity experiments using varying mixing schemes in an existing
configuration of the NEMO global ocean model (used in the IPSL climate model).

The second objective of the project will be to delineate the processes driving Southern
Ocean overturning circulation change in the context of ongoing climate change. The ocean
responds to climate change through modifications of heat, freshwater and momentum
fluxes at its boundaries. Recent work has started to highlight the potential important
contribution of thermodynamic drivers (change in air-sea heat fluxes) over mechanical
drivers (change in momentum fluxes) in impacting some large horizontal current systems
worldwide (Shi et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2022). But the relative importance of these drivers
on the vertical circulation, as well as the time evolution of the respective role of each driver
under past and future climate change remains a knowledge gap. This gap will be addressed
in this project from a newly developed modeling framework, allowing to isolate the
contributions of heat, freshwater and momentum fluxes at the ocean surface to drive ocean
change (Silvy et al., 2022a). We will leverage existing simulations that have been run based
on a large ensemble experiment (historical+SSP2-4.5) developed for CMIP6 with the IPSL
climate model (Silvy et al., 2022a,b).
