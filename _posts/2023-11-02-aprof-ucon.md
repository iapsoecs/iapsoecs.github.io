The application review process will begin on Wednesday, January 3, 2024.

The Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Connecticut invites applications for a 9-month position as an Assistant or Associate Professor in physical oceanography. We seek candidates with physical oceanographic expertise, which can range from turbulent microscales to submesoscale processes. All areas of physical oceanography will be considered, but candidates whose research program includes the study of mixing in marine waters (with application to coastal and open-ocean settings) are preferred. Research approaches can include field observations, numerical modeling, and/or laboratory experiments. The successful candidate will teach courses and advise students within the Marine Sciences undergraduate (BS, BA) and graduate Oceanography (MS, PhD) degree programs.
