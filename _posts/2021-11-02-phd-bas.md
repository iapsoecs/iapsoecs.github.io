We are seeking a PhD student to join the Polar Oceans team at the British Antarctic Survey, funded through the INSPIRE programme at the University of Southampton. This project will use the MITgcm model to investigate how climate change could impact ice-ocean interactions in the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. The student will be supervised by myself (Kaitlin Naughten) with additional supervision by Profs Paul Holland and Alberto Naveria-Garabato. The application deadline is 4 January, for a start date of October 2022. As I am currently on maternity leave, please send all enquiries to both myself (kaight@bas.ac.uk) and Paul Holland (pahol@bas.ac.uk) to ensure a timely response. For full project details and to make an application, see https://noc.ac.uk/gsnocs/project/untangling-effects-climate-change-ice-shelf-melting-amundsen-sea-antarctica .
