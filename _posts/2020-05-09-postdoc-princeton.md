The Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University, in association with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC), seeks a postdoctoral or a more senior scientist to conduct research on improving U.S. commercial fishery stock assessments using regional ocean models.  The goals of the research are to: 1) analyze regional ocean model hindcasts of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean in relation to historical stock assessment estimates and retrospective patterns for key commercial species in the U.S. Northeast Shelf; 2) use a state-space modeling approach to incorporate physical and biological variables from the regional model hindcasts into stock assessment models; 3) apply state-of-the-art regional ocean forecasts to stock estimates.
In addition to a strong quantitative and statistical background, the selected candidate should have one or more of the following attributes: (a) a strong background in fisheries science, marine ecology, or a closely related field, and (b) experience with ocean or climate models.
Candidates must have a Ph.D. in Fisheries Science, Oceanography, or a closely related field.  The initial appointment is for one year with the possibility of a second-year renewal subject to satisfactory performance and available funding.
Complete applications, including a cover letter, CV, publication list, and 3 letters of recommendation should be submitted by August 1, 2020 for full consideration. Applicants should apply online to https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/16021.  For additional information, contact Dr. Vincent Saba (mailto:vincent.saba@noaa.gov).
