# Scientist on Coupled Satellite Data Assimilation (ref. VN25-026), Grade A2, Reading, UK or Bonn, Germany

We have an exciting opportunity for a highly motivated scientist to advance our exploitation of satellite data in ECMWFâ€™s coupled global forecasting system. The role will prepare the use of radiance products from the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR), planned to be launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2029. CIMR will provide a wealth of Earth observation information both on surface conditions as well as the atmosphere. The successful candidate will play a crucial role in preparing the exploitation of this information for global Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), with a particular focus on sea-surface temperature (SST) information.   

Contract type and duration: STF-PL contract from 01 Aug 2025 to 30 Sept 2027

Close date for applications: 15 May 2025
