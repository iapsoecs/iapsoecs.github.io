British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is looking for an exceptional Ocean Modeller to join our Polar Oceans team.  BAS delivers and enables world-leading interdisciplinary research in the polar regions. We employ experts from many different professions to carry out our science as well as keep the lights on, feed the research and support teams, and keep everyone safe!

Working at BAS is rewarding.  Our skilled science, operational and support staff based in Cambridge, Antarctica and the Arctic, work together to deliver research that uses the polar regions to advance our understanding of Earth as a sustainable planet. Through our extensive logistic capability and know how, BAS facilitates access for the British and international science community to the UK polar research operation. Numerous national and international collaborations, combined with an excellent infrastructure, help sustain a world leading position for the UK in Antarctic affairs.  British Antarctic Survey is a component of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), which is part of UK Research and Innovation (www.ukri.org).

As a valued member of our team, you’ll be eligible for the following benefits:

* 30 days annual leave plus bank holidays and 2.5 privilege days, pro-rata
* Excellent civil service pension (with 26% or more employer contribution, depending on your pay band)

You’ll be joining our Polar Oceans team and will conduct research as part of a collaborative project with partners at the Institute of Marine Research (Tromsø, Norway) and NORCE (Bergen, Norway).

You’ll help us to deliver exciting and impactful interdisciplinary science for one of the most remote regions of the planet. Your research will help further our understanding of the impact of climate drivers on ocean dynamics in the South Orkney Islands region and the implications for Antarctic krill distribution variability in this marine mammal and krill fishing hotspot.

Within the role, there will be an opportunity to develop your scientific career in collaboration with scientists across BAS and beyond. We offer support and guidance in applying for funding, including a tailored mentorship scheme for fellowship applications. Training is available on model development and analysis techniques where required, and more broadly on skills for career development such as grant writing and scientific leadership.

Some of your main responsibilities will include:

* Development of a very high-resolution ocean-sea ice model of the northwest South Orkney Plateau and verification of the model by comparison with existing in-situ data.
* Conducting a series of process tests and multi-year simulations with the validated model to explore the drivers of oceanographic variability within the canyons of the northwest South Orkney Plateau.
