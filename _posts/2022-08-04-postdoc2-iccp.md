Employer: IBS Center for Climate Physics

Location: Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea

Education Level: PhD

Job type: Postdoctoral Fellow

Salary: 54 million KRW/year (~43,000 USD)

Term: Full Time, 2 years, with possibility for renewal

Applicants for this position should have a PhD in physics, climate sciences, meteorology, oceanography, biogeochemistry or a related field. Candidates are expected to have strong computational skills, excitement to work on a new research subject, a good publication record, a high level of independence, curiosity and creativity, and an interest in working in an international and interdisciplinary research environment. The successful candidate will work with Dr. Eun Young Kwon and Prof. Axel Timmermann to analyze a suite of ultra-high resolution climate simulations conducted with OpenIFS/FESOM to study future changes in submarine heat waves and corresponding shifts in ecological niches of twilight zone organisms. The twilight zone at a depth of 200-1,000 m plays a central role in carbon and nutrient cycling and hosts a surprising biological diversity. This project will improve our understanding of how greenhouse warming will impact on one of the most fascinating and understudied marine ecosystems.

The IBS Center for Climate Physics (ICCP), (http://iccp.ibs.re.kr) directed by Dr. Axel Timmermann, is dedicated to advancing the understanding of natural climate variability, man-made climate change and their impacts on the hydrological cycle, regional processes, ice-sheets, and sea level. The ICCP is generously funded through the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) (http://ibs.re.kr). 

Please submit a cover letter (using the reference PD-05-2022), a short statement of your research interests, curriculum vitae, the name of 2 references, and up to three publications to Ms. Jenny Choi (hahadaye@pusan.ac.kr). The review of the applications will start on August 15th, 2022. If you have any further questions regarding this position, please contact Dr. Eun Young Kwon (ekwon957@gmail.com).
