Full-time postdoctoral scholar position to work with scientists in the Ocean Mixing Group (https://mixing.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/) at Oregon State University in using existing long time series of mixing data and artificial intelligence methods to develop parameterizations for ocean numerical models.
This position is affiliated with Physics of Oceans and Atmospheres in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS) (https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/physics-oceans-and-atmospheres).
Primary responsibilities include:
1. performing extensive analysis of data from shipboard measurements, newly developed mixing meters (pods), as well as ancillary data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) equatorial mooring arrays in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans
2. taking the lead in training a neural network to develop mixing parameterizations using existing data
3. implementation of these parameterizations into numerical models operated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research to test the results
4. publication of results in scientific journals
Qualifications include:
• Ph.D. in oceanography, climate science, physics or a related field
• strong analytical skills with experience in data analysis in addition to theory and/or numerical modeling
• interest in developing/adapting AI techniques to ocean mixing data and ocean models
• demonstrated ability to distill, articulate and publish results in scientific journals
• demonstrated ability to work independently as well as in collaboration with a team of research scientists
To apply: please send your CV and cover letter with the names and contact information of three references to jim.moum@oregonstate.edu.
Salary: Commensurate with qualifications and experience as per OSU
