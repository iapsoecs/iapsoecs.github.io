The Wozniak Marine Organic Geochemistry (WozMOG) lab at the University of
Delaware (Hugh R. Sharp campus in Lewes, DE) seeks a laboratory coordinator
to perform a variety of duties related to ongoing projects and activities.
The position is a 40 hr/week salaried (commensurate with experience)
position with benefits. Experience with and enthusiasm for operating and
maintaining analytical instrumentation is desired. A degree(s) in
Chemistry, Marine Science, or a related field is also strongly desired.
Interested parties at all levels of experience will be considered and are
encouraged to *inquire with Dr. Andrew Wozniak via email (*
*awozniak@udel.edu* *)*.

Lab coordinator duties will include: operating, maintaining, and

supplies and/or equipment; assisting lab members with various aspects of
research in the laboratory and field including facilitating sample
analyses; data processing/analysis and archiving, sample field collections;
preparation of presentations, reports, publications, and proposals.

The WozMOG lab performs organic geochemical research in marine,
atmospheric, and watershed environments. Current projects include studies
of salt marsh organic carbon and nutrient dynamics, controls on surfactant
organic matter chemical composition and physical properties in the surface
ocean, estuarine dissolved organic matter biogeochemistry, and hydrothermal
vent systems as mediators of aromatic organic matter in the ocean. The
WozMOG lab performs analyses onsite using Shimadzu TOC analyzers, GC-FID
(with MS capability), Horiba Aqualog, a Costech CHN elemental analyzer, and
a membrane inlet mass spectrometer. Additional analyses performed at UofD
or elsewhere include inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus analyses, 1H & 13C
NMR spectroscopy, isotope ratio mass spectrometry, and FTICR-MS.
