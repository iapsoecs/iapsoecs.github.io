I would appreciate your assistance in sharing a new job opening that we have here at the Cape Eleuthera Institute in The Bahamas. This is a great opportunity for an ECR (PhD preferred) to start an independent research program whilst joining an existing collaboration working with sea gliders in the western Atlantic. This is a teaching and research role with a teaching component 2-day per week commitment during spring and autumn semesters.
