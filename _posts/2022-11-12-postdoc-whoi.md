Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is currently searching for a Postdoctoral Investigator to join the Physical Oceanography Department. This is a temporary, full-time, exempt position, and is eligible for benefits. The initial appointment will be for one year with the possibility of a one-year extension.



The Postdoc will split their time working on datasets from the Pacific Arctic and Subpolar North Atlantic. For the former, the postdoc will analyze a recently collected hydrographic/velocity survey of the Chukchi Sea to investigate various aspects of the shelf circulation and water mass distribution. For the latter, the postdoc will analyze data from a mooring array across shelf/slope of southwest Greenland as part of the Overturning of the Subpolar North Atlantic Project (OSNAP) to investigate aspects of the boundary current system.



The Institution has a top-rated postdoctoral program (www.whoi.edu/postdoctoral/<http://www.whoi.edu/postdoctoral/>) that supports a dynamic postdoctoral community with formal mentoring and career guidance programs. While the primary focus of the work will be in research, the Postdoctoral Investigator will have the opportunity to participate in educational and outreach activities associated with the project.



Online application forms should be submitted via the appropriate fields in the application with a research statement describing research accomplishments, current work, future direction, and career goals; a complete curriculum vitae; up to three relevant publications; and a cover letter that contains the contact information of at least three references.
