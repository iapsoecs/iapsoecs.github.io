Post-doc position at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Wave mean flow interactions

Description: Conduct analysis of an observational dataset from oceanographic moorings to resolve seasonal evolution of energy exchanges of near-inertial waves and mean flows in a highly dynamic environment. Analysis will involve some data quality control, and numerical model analysis depending on the candidate’s experience, interest and qualifications. Contact Amy Waterhouse awaterhouse@ucsd.edu or Gunnar Voet gvoet@ucsd.edu for further information.

Qualifications: Applicants should have 0-2 years of Postdoctoral experience, or be nearing completion of their Ph.D. (estimated within 3 months), and be self-motivated and hard-working. Good written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to produce scientific publications and presentations and meet project milestones are required. Strong analytical background with a Ph.D. in physical oceanography or a related field. Programming experience working in scripting languages such as Python, R, or Matlab is highly desired. Experience with observational datasets is desired but not required.

Appointment Length/Period: Initial appointment is for two years. Desired start date is April 1, 2023, or by mutual agreement.

Application Procedure: Please contact Amy Waterhouse or Gunnar Voet via email with a CV including a list of any publications, a personal statement of the candidate’s experience and career goals, and the names and email contact information for three referees.
