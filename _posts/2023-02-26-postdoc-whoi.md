Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is currently searching for a Postdoctoral Investigator to join the Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department. This is a temporary, full-time, exempt position, and is eligible for benefits. The initial appointment will be for two years with the possibility of a third year extension.

Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a promising marine carbon dioxide removal approach identified by a recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report. Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Investigator position in developing and executing a scaled series of ship-based ocean alkalinity enhancement field trials. The successful candidate will work with an interdisciplinary set of colleagues in the Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry and Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering Departments to select appropriate deployment sites; plan the trials; and analyze and synthesize field data to characterize the alkalinity and carbon budgets of the deployed plumes. Additional opportunities include developing devices and methods for shipboard tracer and alkalinity deployment, understanding the biogeochemical response to the deployment, and synthesizing multiple shipboard data streams to contextualize the trials within the region. The position will entail field and lab work in Massachusetts and opportunities to go to sea.

The institution has a top-rated postdoctoral program (www.whoi.edu/postdoctoral/<http://www.whoi.edu/postdoctoral/>) that supports a dynamic postdoctoral community with formal mentoring and career guidance programs. While the primary focus of the work will be in research, the Postdoctoral Investigator will have the opportunity to participate in educational and outreach activities associated with the project.

Online application forms should be submitted with a cover letter, complete curriculum vitae, and the names of three individuals willing to write a letter of recommendation for the candidate. Applications will be reviewed starting February 15, 2023, and until the position is filled. The position can start immediately. Interested applicants can contact Dr. Adam V. Subhas (asubhas@whoi.edu<mailto:asubhas@whoi.edu>).
