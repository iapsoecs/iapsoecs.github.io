We have a position available for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join an Australian Research Council (ARC) grant-funded team modelling intrusions into density-stratified fluids.  The research will be in collaboration with Dr Anja Slim (School of Mathematics and School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment, Monash), Prof Stefan Llewellyn Smith (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Engineering, UCSD) and Prof Murray Rudman (Faculty of Engineering, Monash).  The position will be based at Monash with research visits to the US.

The aims of the project are (1) to understand the interaction and feedback between the dynamics of the intrusion and internal waves generated in the ambient fluid and (2) develop a reduced-order model for predicting the dynamics of these flows in a variety of applications such as the early evolution of volcanic ash clouds and meso-scale oceanic flows such as the Mediterranean overflow.

The position is two years.  Start date and work fraction are negotiable.  

Salary: $75,115 - $101,944 AUD per year (plus 17% employer superannuation)
