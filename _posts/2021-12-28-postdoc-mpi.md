The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) is a multidisciplinary center for climate and Earth system research located in Hamburg, Germany. It is one of the premier climate science research institutes in the world. Located in the heart of one of Europe’s most livable and vibrant cities, it provides a highly international and interdisciplinary environment to conduct scientific research as well as access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities. You can also find a virtual tour of our campus here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX2taTz_zP8  .

 

The Climate-Biosphere Interactions (CBI) research group at MPI-M invites applications for a

 

Postdoctoral Scientist (W101 | all genders)

 

in the A1 project “Carbon Dynamics in the Arctic” of the DFG Excellence Cluster CLICCS. The main responsibility of the postdoc is the integrated analysis of land and ocean biogeochemistry in the Arctic using local-scale observations, evaluating and projecting carbon dynamics in the Arctic by using the novel Earth System Model, ICON-ESM. It is envisaged that the postdoc will be based at MPI-M and closely collaborate with UHH researchers doing observations and modelling of carbon dynamics on the local scale. Responsibility also includes co-supervision of PhD students in projects.

 

Your profile

·         PhD in physical Geosciences, Meteorology, Environmental Sciences, or a similar discipline  obtained by the starting date;

·         Experience in supercomputer simulations of state-of-the-art Earth System Models and especially their land surface components, such as JSBACH;

·         Field work experience and willingness to participate in the UHH expeditions to observation sites in the Arctic would be a plus;

·         Expertise in analysis of global remote sensing data and their application for the ESM evaluation;

·         Expertise in Fortran, UNIX/Linux, Python, shell scripting, processing and visualization of simulation data;

·         Good communication skills, ability to work autonomously and self-responsible;

·         Readiness to co-supervise PhD students;

·         Excellent writing skills in English.

 

What we offer

·           Participation in a challenging part of science in an international, intellectually stimulating environment established for the benefit of science and society, not of turnover increases;

·           Complex workflows on the bleeding edge of what is technologically possible;

·           Very good opportunities for self-realization, freedom in and influence upon the decisions what to do, and how to do it;
