The High Meadows Environmental Institute at Princeton University is seeking a Postdoctoral research associate or more senior researcher in the area of ocean biophysical modeling to work with Professor Laure Resplandy. The researcher will investigate the impact of climate change and human perturbations on ocean oxygenation and coastal hypoxia in the Indian Ocean. The researcher will specifically examine how riverine nutrient loadings and aerosol deposition control oxygen levels and how the risk of coastal hypoxia, which is crucial for ecosystem and ecosystem services, will evolve in the future. The position is funded by an NSF CAREER grant (Award # 2042672).

The ideal candidate will have a strong background in numerical modeling, but candidates with the necessary background in geophysical fluid dynamics and/or ocean biogeochemistry will be given full consideration. A Ph.D. in Geosciences or related field is required. The position is available for one year, with a possibility for renewal contingent upon satisfactory performance and funding. Postdoctoral appointments are initially for one year with the renewal for subsequent years based on satisfactory performance and continued funding. A competitive salary is offered commensurate with experience and qualifications.
Applicants are asked to submit a cover letter, vitae, a publication list, a statement of research experience and interests, and names of at least 3 references. Applicants should apply online to https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/24941. Review of applications will begin as soon as they are received and continue until the position is filled. This position is subject to the University's background check policy.
