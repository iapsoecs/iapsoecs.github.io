Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is currently searching for two Postdoctoral Investigators to join the Ocean Acoustics and Signals Laboratory in the Applied Ocean Physics & Engineering (AOPE) Department.  These are temporary, full-time, exempt positions, and are eligible for benefits. The initial appointments will be for 18 to 24 months.

The project will investigate ocean acoustic technologies to sense, characterize and anaylize physical oceanographic environments and/or biological ecosystems. Research will be conducted both in the laboratory and at sea.

The Institution has a top-rated postdoctoral program (www.whoi.edu/postdoctoral/) that supports a dynamic postdoctoral community with formal mentoring and career guidance programs. While the primary focus of the work will be in research, the Postdoctoral Investigator will have the opportunity to participate in educational and outreach activities associated with the project.

Online application forms should be submitted with a cover letter describing research interests and career goals, a complete curriculum vitae, up to three relevant publications, and the contact information of at least three references. Applications will be reviewed starting Feb 15, 2020 and until the position is filled.
Essential Functions

    Acoustic sensing, characterization/classification and localization algorithm development, and hydrophone arrays data analyses.
    Participating sea trial cruises and assisting on conducting field work experiments.
    Work well in a large interdisciplinary group.
    Writing peer-reviewed publications and presenting reseach results at national and international scientific meetings.

 
Education & Experience

    PhD. in Ocean Acoustics, Signal Processing, Acoustical Oceanography, or a related discipline.
    Less than 2 years of postdoctoral experience.
    Previous experience in underwater acoustic signal processing, acoustical oceanography, ocean acoustics is desirable.
    Previous successful experience working with interdisciplinary groups is viewed as a positive.

 
Physical Requirements

Physical duties for this position include but are not limited to, ability to lift 25 lbs independently, 2 times per day; carry 10-25 lbs, 2 times per day. Visual abilities to include near, far, peripheral, depth perception, and ability to distinguish basic colors. Hearing requirements include the ability to hear and respond to instructions, communicate effectively in loud areas (pier/dock, warehouse). Other physical tasks include occasional prolonged standing/walking; use of hands for basic /fine grasping and manipulation, repetitive motion, reaching above and below the shoulders, pushing, pulling, kneeling, bending, twisting, and stooping. Other occupational requirements include talking, traveling, working around others, and with others. Will be exposed to dust or other irritants and electrical/mechanical/power equipment hazards. Physical duties are subject to change.
Sea Duty

May work at least 8 hours per day and, at times in excess of 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Sleep and work hours can deviate from those on land. May be expected to work on watch schedule (such as 8 hours on and 8 hours off or 12 hours on and 8 hours off) for all or part of a cruise or to work as hours are needed to accomplish the planned work. May need to travel during holidays and for long distances to and from foreign ports. May experience rudimentary living and working conditions, with shared and basic living quarters and laboratories. May experience bad or extreme weather conditions, including heavy seas, winter weather or hot, tropical weather. Work on deck may occur in both hot and cold conditions around the clock. Sea conditions will lead to active ship motion. Should be able to climb steep and vertical ladders and able to enter and exit compartments through hatches, doors, and sills. Should be able to carry heavy gear and participate in the loading and unloading of the ship as well as in the activities on deck and in the labs during the cruise. Shipboard environment may include: confined areas, shared sleeping quarters (berths) and bathroom facilities, small and basic berthing, fixed meal times and basic menus. Modest levels of heating, cooling, ventilation, and illumination, limited or no email and internet access and limited off-duty and recreational facilities (library, lounge, movies). May be exposed to potential allergens and irritants, including paint fumes. May experience constant and intermittent loud noises, and slippery and uneven surfaces.
