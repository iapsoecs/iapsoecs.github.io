The Institut Pierre-Simon-Laplace (IPSL) at Sorbonne Université and École Normale Supérieure have two postdoctoral openings within the EU Horizon 2020 funded Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Current Century project (4C). Both positions are 24-months long and located in central Paris.

Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Current Century (4C) addresses crucial knowledge gaps in the climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide emissions, by reducing the uncertainty in our quantitative understanding of carbon-climate interactions and feedbacks. This will be achieved through innovative integration of models and observations, providing new constraints on modelled carbon-climate interactions and climate projections, and supporting IPCC assessments and policy objectives.

Post 1 – Carbon Cycle Prediction: The post-doc will evaluate predictability and predictions of ocean and land carbon sinks in a suite of dedicated experiments based on the IPSL Earth System Model. The first two series of experiments are already available. Based on the CO2-concentration driven configuration of the model, they are designed to evaluate predictability in a perfect model framework and the effective historical prediction skill given the CMIP6-DCPP (Decadal Climate Prediction Project) strategy adopted at IPSL. Prediction horizons and mechanisms will be assessed, evaluated and compared. Evaluation could also include comparison with results from other members of the 4C-consortium. The third series of experiments will repeat prediction experiments in emission driven mode. These simulations will be performed by the postdoctoral fellow, in close interactions with the IPSL-EPOC “Decadal Working group” in charge of performing these predictions. The post will be supervised by Laurent Bopp (Ecole Normale Supérieure/CNRS) Patricia Cadule (Sorbonne Université/CNRS) and Juliette Mignot (Sorbonne Université/IRD).

Post 2 – Emergent Constraints: The postdoc will devise new techniques to constrain future projections of climate-ocean feedbacks and the resulting impact on the ocean carbon cycle. Of particular interest is the application of “Emergent Constraints”, which mechanistically relate observable aspects of the climate system with future multi-model projection uncertainties and can be used to identify key areas of model development. Such approaches have been previously applied to constrain projections of future marine primary production. Utilising Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5/CMIP6) outputs the postdoc will extend such approaches to projections of biological carbon export. Identified constraints will be validated across model generations and explored with simulations of the PISCES ocean biogeochemical model in order to identify model development priorities. The post will be supervised by Lester Kwiatkowski (Sorbonne Université/CNRS) and Laurent Bopp (Ecole Normale Superieure/CNRS).

Applications should be sent as soon as possible and before 31 July 2020 to:

- Juliette Mignot (Juliette.Mignot@locean-ipsl.upmc.fr) for Post 1

- Lester Kwiatkowski (lmorgan@locean-ipsl.upmc.fr) for Post 2

Applications should specify the post of interest and include a CV, a statement of research interests and the names of two references.
