Please find enclosed a post-doctoral research position open at LHEEA lab
(Centrale Nantes - CNRS, Nantes, Fr https://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/).

We are hiring a postdoc for a project involving research actions linked
to the analysis of the MABL and wind/wave interaction in a broad range
of applications depending on the candidate background.

The Dynamics of Urban and Coastal Atmosphere team in the Laboratory of Hydrodynamics,
Energetics and Atmospheric Environment (LHEEA) is working on marine atmospheric boundary
layer (MABL) in offshore and coastal environment for both fundamental and applied topics. The
research team is continuously operating field measurement campaigns (wind LiDAR, scanner
and profiler, sonic anemometer...) from the shore or at sea and has several numerical models
ranging from LES at micro-scale to analyze wind-wave interaction to WRF-LES to study meso-
scale dynamics in the MABL. The variety of approaches allows to tackle the spatial and temporal
complexities.

The project would involve research actions linked to the analysis of the MABL and wind/wave
interaction in a broad range of applications depending on the candidate background including:
- analysis of the momentum transfer between the atmosphere and the sea surface by means of
LiDAR measurements on site (L. Paskin, B. Conan, Y. Perignon and S. Aubrun
https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14133007)
- modeling of wind-wave at microscale (L. Paskin, B. Conan, Y. Perignon and S. Aubrun
https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13122012)
- analysis of wind profiles over the sea interacting with the wave surface (B. Conan and A Visich
https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-2023-141 and W. Bruch and B. Conan,
https://ams.confex.com/ams/103ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/416635 )

**Prerequisites:**

- A Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Geosciences, Computational Mathematics,
- A first successful experience in one of the following topics: atmospheric turbulence analysis, data processing, micro-scale wind-wave modeling, meso-scale wind wave modeling, LiDAR measurements would be a great added value,
- Good verbal and written communication skills.
