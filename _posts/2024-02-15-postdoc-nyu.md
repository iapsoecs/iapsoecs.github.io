We are inviting applications for highly motivated Postdoctoral Researchers at NYU Courant and CDS, to work on a new generation of global climate models augmented with AI, as part of the international project, MÂ²LInES. The scientific goal of this project is to improve climate predictions by reducing climate model errors at the air-sea/ice interface using machine learning (ML) models. Read more about our recent progress summarized here or our publications.

The successful candidate will work with Profs Laure Zanna & Carlos Fernandez-Granda and their groups at NYU, together with the GFDL/Princeton and NCAR groups. We are looking for candidates interested in exploring at least one of the following ideas:

- The dynamics of key ocean and climate variables, e.g., sea level or sea surface temperature. 
- The role of ocean dynamics and the pattern effect in coupled idealized simulations (e.g., Wu et al., 2021).
- ML-driven assessment of climate models and extremes (e.g., Mardani et al., 2023).

The position, available immediately, is a full-time appointment, initially for one year, with the possibility of renewal for up to 3 years, subject to satisfactory performance and available funding.

Applications should be uploaded at: https://apply.interfolio.com/140348
