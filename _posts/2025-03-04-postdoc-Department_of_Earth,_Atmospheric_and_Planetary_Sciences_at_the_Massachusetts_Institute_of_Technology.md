We write to advertise a Postdoctoral Associate position in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The successful applicant will work with Assistant Professor Abigail Bodner as part of a multi-institutional team including Leah Johnson (Applied Physics Lab/U Washington), Shafer Smith (NYU/Courant), Dhruv Balwada (Columbia/LDEO), and  Spencer Jones (Texas A&M).

The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) altimeter mission is starting to provide measurements of sea surface height at an unprecedented resolution, revealing strikingly clear submesoscale features at scales down to about a kilometer. The ideal candidate will contribute to our collaboration by offering expertise in ocean observations, submesoscale dynamics, and data analysis techniques, complementing ongoing efforts in developing mathematical and machine learning methods to infer upper-ocean transport from SWOT. We aim to tackle challenges involved in delineating submesoscales from the overlapping fast internal wave signals captured in the SWOT data, and how to best leverage information given by other lower resolution remote sensing products and in-situ measurements to infer submesoscale transport. We are eager to bring on a talented postdoctoral associate to help us advance this goal, starting as soon as possible.

 

 

## Job Requirements:

PhD in physical oceanography or a related field at the time of the appointment, with expertise in remote sensing and in-situ ocean measurements. Experience and/or interest in working with numerical simulations, scientific programming, or machine learning is an advantage.

 

 

## Application instructions:

please apply online via https://hr.mit.edu/careers (job ID # 24871) applicants are asked to send a CV, a brief statement of research interests, and the names of three references to abodner@mit.edu with postdoc job in the subject.

 

Prospective applicants may contact Dr. Bodner (abodner@mit.edu) with any questions regarding the nature of the research to be conducted.
