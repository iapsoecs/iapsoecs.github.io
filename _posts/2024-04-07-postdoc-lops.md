Starting Date: 01 September 2024 

12 months fixed-term contract

Application deadline: 15 June 2024 (or until the position is filled)

**Supervisors:**

E. Martinez (elodie.martinez@ird.fr) biogeochemistry/ocean color (LOPS Brest),
P. Brehmer, marine ecologist (LEMAR Brest).

**Collaborators:**

M. Lengaigne, oceanographer/climate physicist & H Demarcq, oceanographer (MARBEC Sète).
T. Gorgues, biogeochemistry/numerical modeler & E. Pauthenet, oceanographer physicist machine learning (LOPS), R. Fablet & L. Drumetz, machine learning (Lab-STICC Brest),

**Salary:** 34,52 k€ (gross) /year

**Host institution**

The position is affiliated with the Physical and Space Oceanography Laboratory (LOPS),
a Joint Research Unit associated with the University of western Brittany (UBO) both belonging
to the European University Institute of the Sea (IUEM). Recently recognized as one of the
world's premier oceanographic centers (ranked 5th in the Shanghai ranking 2023), LOPS
spearheads cutting-edge research in ocean dynamics across various temporal and spatial scales. Our four LOPS research teams (Coastal Ocean, Ocean and Climate, Oceanic Scale Interactions, and Satellites and Air-Sea Interface) pioneer programs contributing to the advancement on the relationships between the ocean and other compartments of the Earth system such as the atmosphere, ice and living organisms.
Based in Plouzané (France), the postdoc opportunity is within the "Ocean and Climate"
team.

**The project**

NextGEMS is a collaborative European project (https://nextgems-h2020.eu; PI Bjorn
Stevens at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology and Irina Sandu at the ECMWF). This
postdoctoral position falls under the “Storms and Ocean” NextGEMS theme, led by Noel
Keenlyside (UiB Norway). NextGEMS, funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 program, will tap
expertise from fourteen European Nations to develop two next generation Storm-Resolving
Earth-system Models (SR-ESMs). The much finer grid of nextGEMS’ models allows them to
explicitly represent essential climate processes – storms, associated with precipitating deep
convection, the effects of the landscape on the atmosphere, the effects of ocean eddies on the
ocean heat transport, and its interaction with ice-sheets – that existing climate models now
either ignore, or represent empirically. Past research has shown that the physically based
approaches nextGEMS exploits are effective in reducing systematic and long-standing errors
in conventional climate models, thereby creating a better – more physical – foundation for projections. Because nextGEMS’s SR-ESMs will increase simulation realism on many fronts,
they are expected to open new scientific frontiers and shine new light on how the Earth system
responds to human activities.

Within this thematic framework, and based on experience in our team (Martinez et al.,
2020a; 2020b; Roussillon et al., 2023) advanced machine learning techniques will be used to
derive climate projections of phytoplankton biomass from oceanographic and atmospheric
physical predictors from SR-ESMs in order to ultimately deconvolute and investigate the
influence of the anthropogenic signal from that of the natural low-frequency variability.

**Your activities**

1. Apply machine learning tools and supervised methods already developed and in use within
our team to learn the relationships between the concentration of Chlorophyll-a (“Chl”, a
proxy of phytoplankton biomass) from satellite observations and physical oceanographic
and atmospheric predictors (temperature, wind, etc.) from the SR-ESM models over the
historical time period. Then, apply these machine learning schemes on the physical
predictors from the two nextGEMS SR-ESM climate projections over the next decades.
This part of the work will be performed with our team support (additional collab. with R.
Fablet and L. Drumetz from the LabSTICC lab).

2. Assess the part of the natural variability vs. anthropogenic trend in Chl predictions.

3. Characterize the underlying physical and climate mechanisms.

4. Compare these results with those already obtained by our team on the low resolutions
CMIP6 ESMs (collaboration from point 2 to 4, with M. Lengaigne from the MARBEC
lab.)

5. Following a first assessment at global scale from point 1 to 4, a focus will be performed
specifically on the North West African region for points 2 and 3, where questions about
the evolution of the small pelagic fish arise (collaborations with P. Brehmer from LEMAR
and H. Demarcq from MARBEC laboratories).

6. Disseminate your findings through publication in peer-reviewed "rank A" journals and
effective communication of results.
