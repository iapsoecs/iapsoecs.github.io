Fixed-term, full time position for 3 years to conduct research and teaching. Based in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.

IMAS/UTAS is a funded partner organisation in the Australian Government National Environmental Science Program (NESP) Climate Systems Hub. UTAS is one of 5 universities, joining with CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology to form the hub. Through the partner universities, the Climate Systems Hub is seeking postdoctoral researchers with a strong interest in addressing Australia’s climate science challenges and climate adaptation needs.

The Opportunity

This position will contribute to IMAS’s ambition to further develop its reputation for world-class research in marine and Antarctic science. The successful candidate will undertake research in this highly interdisciplinary area, guided by co-design, building on existing strengths in IMAS in climate science, oceanography and biogeochemistry, new technologies and emerging datasets. The successful candidate is expected to explore opportunities and apply for relevant competitive research grants, publish their findings in high-profile international peer-reviewed journals and work with NESP knowledge brokers to better engage with, and communicate the findings to, the Australian government, NESP stakeholders and the broader community.

Key Accountabilities

-  Work within the NESP Climate Systems Hub Oceans and Coasts Project to progress understanding of oceanic processes that play a leading role in Australian and global climate variability with an emphasis on Australian boundary current connections to the deep ocean.

- A PhD or equivalent in fluid dynamics, physical oceanography, atmospheric science, applied mathematics or an equivalent field.
- Knowledge of climate processes, particularly atmosphere/ocean dynamics.
- Experience in analysing large datasets and/or model outputs to develop understanding of ocean or climate variability and related physical processes.
- A strong record in research that has achieved national and international recognition and made innovative contributions to the field of physical oceanography, demonstrated by a record of high-quality publications, presentations at conferences and applications for external competitive funding.
- Commitment to undertake research that will contribute to contractual milestones in the NESP Climate Systems Hub.
- Involvement in supervision of Honours or research higher degree (PhD) students and in University-level teaching and learning.
- Contribution to building effective and productive links within the discipline, profession, industry (where relevant) and wider community.
