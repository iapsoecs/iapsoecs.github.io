A fully-funded PhD project is available at Northumbria University (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) under the OnePlanet <https://research.ncl.ac.uk/one-planet/> Doctoral Training Partnership. The student will use high-resolution ocean modelling to understand the
processes that control the melting of Antarctic ice-shelf cavities. Full details are here <https://research.ncl.ac.uk/one-planet/studentships/OP2152%20-%20Christopher%20Bull,%20'Revealing%20the%20role%20of%20eddies%20and%20buoyancy%20fluxes%20in%20projected%20regime%20shifts%20in%20the%20ocean%20circulation%20under%20Antarctica%E2%80%99s%20ice%20shelves'.pdf>.

*Application deadline: 18th January 2021*
