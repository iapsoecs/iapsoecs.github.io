Opportunity for Graduate Research in Offshore Wind Energy

**Overview**

The Atmospheric Sciences Research Center and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at the State University of New York at Albany are pleased to announce an opening for a highly motivated PhD student to make state-of-the-art measurements of air-sea interaction as part of a project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The scientific objective is to improve the understanding of air-sea interaction from the sea surface to the top of the marine atmospheric boundary layer. This capability will support basic studies of air-sea interaction physics and applied fields such as offshore wind energy.

**Project Description**

The project involves development of an autonomous system for turbulent air-sea fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat using the eddy covariance technique that will be integrated into  a floating buoy-based lidar. The successful student will assist with design, fabrication, and testing of the system, process and analyze data, present results at scientific conferences, and publish in peer-reviewed journals. Motivated students with an interest in geophysical fluid mechanics, turbulence, renewable energy with an emphasis on  offshore wind are encouraged to apply.

**Qualifications Desired**

  *   BS or MS degree in physical sciences (atmospheric sciences, oceanography, engineering or a related discipline)
  *   interest in field work and instrumentation
  *   experience with field observations, data acquisition, and data processing is beneficial
  *   willingness to travel

**Application Procedure**

Candidates are encouraged to contact Dr. Scott Miller (smiller@albany.edu<mailto:smiller@albany.edu>) or Dr. Jeff Freedman (jfreedman@albany.edu) by email before applying. Information on applying to the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at the University at Albany can be found at https://www.albany.edu/daes.

**Start Date**

The fall semester begins mid-late August 2021; however, the student may begin working in the lab during summer or earlier if interested and available.

**Application Deadline**

The deadline for applying to the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences for admission for fall semester 2021 is January 15, 2021.
