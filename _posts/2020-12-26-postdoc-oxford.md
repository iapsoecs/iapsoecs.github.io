Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Physical Climate Science.

The post is available initially for a fixed-term duration of 2 years.

This role is part of the recently funded NERC ArtiCONNECT project which examines the effects of Arctic warming on European climate and extreme weather. The successful applicant will join a large team of world-leading scientists from several UK universities, the National Oceanography Centre, and the Met Office. The project will investigate the response of the broader climate system to amplified Arctic warming, with a focus on European climate and extreme weather.

The successful candidate will be responsible for performing an unprecedented large ensemble of high-resolution climate model simulations of the response to prescribed Arctic sea ice loss, using the climateprediction.net <http://climateprediction.net> distributed computing network. The researcher will lead in the analysis of these simulations, with a focus on the response of the jet stream and Rossby wave dynamics, and collaborate with the wider project team to advance our understanding of the impact of Arctic warming on European climate.

Applicants should possess, or be very close to obtaining a doctorate in physics or a related field and ideally a strong background in physical climate science.

Previous experience in the field of climate modelling and/or atmospheric dynamics will be an advantage.

Please direct enquiries about the role to Tim Woollings (tim.woollings@physics.ox.ac.uk <http://tim.woollings@physics.ox.ac.uk/> ).

Closing date: 25 January
