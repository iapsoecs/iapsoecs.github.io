We are offering a position for a keen ocean modeller and climate
scientist to develop the NEMO global ocean model with the aim to
improve the simulated circulation in the Southern Ocean. The Southern
Ocean plays an essential role for global climate change because it is
the Earth system’s largest sink for atmospheric heat and carbon. In
turn, warmer Southern Ocean waters accelerate the loss of land-borne
ice from Antarctica, leading to global sea level rise.

The work will mainly consist of developing parameterisations of
mesoscale eddies and related processes. Mesoscale eddies are essential
for processing heat and carbon in the Southern Ocean, but because of
their small size current Earth System models (ESMs) struggle to
represent them adequately. An improved representation will mean lower
levels of uncertainty in climate projections.

Various types of simulations will be conducted, from idealized
configurations with NEMO to fully coupled simulations. The work will
contribute to the development of the next generation of Earth System
models – among them the UK Earth System Model, UKESM – used for
climate projections and the assessment of mitigation and adaptation
measures in response to global climate change.

This work is part of the EU project ESM2025 “Earth System models for
the Future”. The role is based in the Department of Meteorology at the
University of Reading – a world leading centre for weather and climate
science – and will be embedded in the National Centre for Atmospheric
Science (NCAS). A close collaboration with the national development
team of UKESM is envisaged.

You will have:
- A PhD in mathematical or physical science
Physical insight and analytical ability
- A strong interest in the role of oceanic processes in the global climate system
- Experience in developing the code of NEMO or another ocean climate model
- Self-motivation and creativity

The application deadline is 22 June 2022.
Interviews will be held on 8 July 2022.
