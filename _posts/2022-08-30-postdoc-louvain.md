Global climate model simulations still have significant biases in the
extent of summer Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. One of the reasons is
the coarse resolution of the models, which forbids an adequate
representation of the processes that control the evolution of the ice
edge, such as the interactions between sea ice and oceanic eddies, the
influence of landfast ice, the role of coastal currents, the complex
bathymetry, ... In this context, the Georges Lemaître Centre for Earth
and Climate Research (ELIC ;
https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/eli/elic) / Earth and Life
Institute (ELI ; https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/eli) of
the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain ; https://uclouvain.be), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium is seeking a
postdoctoral fellow for conducting and comparing thoroughly
simulations with the global sea ice-ocean general circulation model
NEMO4-SI3 (http://www.nemo-ocean.eu) driven by an atmospheric reanalysis at
two different horizontal resolutions, namely 1° and 1/12°,  in order
to determine how resolution impacts the model mean state and the model
ability to reproduce the summer sea ice extent record lows observed
recently in both the Arctic and Antarctic.

The successful candidate should have a PhD in ocean/sea ice modelling
or related fields, and should have published in peer-reviewed
scientific international journals. Experience in polar
oceanography/glaciology is an asset. Advanced programming,
post-processing and data managment/analysis skills are required.
He/she should be fluent in English due to the multiple interactions
planned with other members of ELIC and should have demonstrated
ability in team working.

The position is offered for 24 months (the starting date can be
negociated). Note that it is only accessible to researchers who did
not spend the last 2 years in a Belgian lab and who have less than
6-yr experience after their PhD thesis defense. The net monthly salary
(incl. social insurance) will amount to 2550-2750 EUR, depending on
seniority. Public transportation to and from the workplace will be
covered.

Applicants should send by e-mail to Thierry Fichefet
(thierry.fichefet@uclouvain.be) (i) a statement of research
experience, qualification and interest, (ii) a complete CV, including
a list of publications, and (iii) the name of two scientists who would
agree to write a letter of recommendation. Review of the applications
will start on September 15th. The call will remain open until the
position is filled.
