The University of Michigan seeks a postdoctoral scholar supervised by Prof. Yulin Pan (Department of
Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/fpel) and co-supervised
by Prof. Brian Arbic (Department of Earth and Environmental Science, https://arbic.earth.lsa.umich.edu/).
The successful applicant will work on quantifying the energy cascade of internal gravity waves (IGWs)
and the ocean mixing process. Specifically, the initial tasks include application of wave turbulence theory
(expertise of Prof. Pan) and high-resolution ocean models (expertise of Prof. Arbic) to quantify the IGW
spectral form and energy flux in wavenumber-frequency space. The successful applicant will also have
opportunities to work with other renowned physicists and oceanographers who collaborate on this project.
The successful applicant is expected to have a Ph.D. in applied mathematics, physics, oceanography, fluid
dynamics and other related fields. Expertise in nonlinear waves and dynamics, turbulence theory,
analytical derivation, high-performance computation and ocean models are preferred. Interested
applicants can directly contact Prof. Yulin Pan at yulinpan@umich.edu with a CV and 1~3 representative
publications.
This position is available immediately. The initial contract would be for one year, which can be extended
upon mutual agreement.
