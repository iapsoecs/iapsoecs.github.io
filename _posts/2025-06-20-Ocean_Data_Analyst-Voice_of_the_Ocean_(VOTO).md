Weâ€™re currently advertising a permanent position for an ocean data analyst as part of our Ocean Science unit at the Voice of the Ocean Foundation in Sweden. VOTO aims to contribute to a world where people can make informed and responsible decisions about the ocean through marine research, educational outreach, oceanic archive solutions and collaboration.  Our Ocean Science team have a primary focus supporting the marine research community, through internal projects such as our Baltic Observatories and through external Ocean Support projects providing infrastructure and technical expertise to researchers. Our infrastructure currently includes 13 underwater gliders, four autonomous surface vessels, a micro AUV and two ROVs, as well as access to three 25 m vessels equipped for research and survey work located around the Baltic and Kattegat. This person will join our Ocean Data team, working in a close group primarily with data from our ocean gliders. 

## Brief description of the role

This person will be contributing to data processing and quality control and supporting core operations to ensure timely openly accessible sharing of the oceanographic data we collect. There will be a focus on the data quality of our biophysical and chemical sensors, contributing to field sampling strategies and working closely with our operations team. You will also engage with the international ocean gliders community to implement and improve upon best practices for data quality and management.  

The role will include opportunities for data analysis, interpretation of data and engaging in communicating trends and results seen. We work in a collaborative team for producing reports and/or scientific papers, and there exist possibilities to become engaged with international research projects.
