A 2-year post-doc contract is offered by the Institute of Oceanography of the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR), located close to Athens, Greece ( https://www.hcmr.gr/en/ ). The position has the possibility of being further renewed and will be open until filled.

Post description:

The post-doctoral researcher will join the Poseidon team of HCMR (poseidon.hcmr.gr) that operates daily forecast services of the sea state. The main duties of the successful candidate are the (1) supervision and (2) improvement of Poseidon's ocean wave forecasting service. In particular, the successful candidate is expected to work closely with the Poseidon team members in order to perform changes to the model code and develop new model packages for the operational models (e.g. data assimilation and stochastic parametrisations). Finally, the successful candidate is expected to take research initiatives, lead the publication of her/his results and assist the supervision of PhD students. While the position is open for an ocean wave modelling expert, we also welcome applications from colleagues with other relevant ocean modelling background.

The post requires:
- A PhD in ocean modelling.
- Excellent communication skills in English.
- Excellent programming skills
- Familiarity with ocean modelling is mandatory, ideally with wave models (e.g. WAM and WAVEWATCH III).

To apply please send to Gerasimos Korres ( gkorres@hcmr.gr ):
- A Cover Letter with a statement of interest in English
- A full CV in English
- Two contacts for further references
