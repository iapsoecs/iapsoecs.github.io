The CMCC Foundation is a scientific research center on climate change and its interactions with the environment, the society, the world of business and policy makers.
Our work aims to stimulate sustainable growth, protect the environment and develop strategies for the adaptation and mitigation of climate change.

Our Division of Ocean Modeling and Data Assimilation is looking for a Marine Biogeochemical/Ecosystem Modeller (Post-doc or Junior Scientist ) to work within the search Unit for Marine Biogeochemistry and Earth System Modelling of the Ocean Modeling and Data Assimilation (ODA) Division.

The primary purpose of this position is to enhance our in-house modelling portfolio based on the Biogeochemical Flux Model (http://bfm-community.eu) and its couplings to dynamic ocean models such as NEMO and SHYFEM and our Earth System Model CMCC-ESM2. Current key research priorities focus on three development streams: coastal processes, polar biogeochemical processes including sea-ice biogeochemistry and parametrisation of marine-based negative emission pathways (nature-based and technology based). The candidate is further expected to work on the implementations of our modelling systems and the analysis of their simulations in the context of global biogeochemical cycles, mitigation and adaptation of climate change as well as biodiversity and ecosystem services.

These activities require a solid base in geoscientific modelling, in-depth knowledge of the scientific state of the art and of the most recent developments in data analysis and statistical methods (e.g. machine learning and artificial intelligence).

The job location is CMCC premises in Bologna, BO, Italy.

We are looking for a motivated person with the following requirements:
    PhD in natural sciences with experience in the fields of oceanography, marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems;
    High standard of scientific outputs, as proven by your scientific track record (considering a career level in line with the position offered);
    Consolidated experience in scientific programming and data analysis, demonstrated skills in FORTRAN and/or python programming as well as parallel computing is of particular advantage;
