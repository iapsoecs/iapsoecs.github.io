Applicants are sought for a postdoctoral position at the University of Michigan. The position is
part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) project “Collaborative Research: Probing internal
gravity wave dynamics and dissipation using global observations and numerical simulations”
(OCE 2319142) and funding is available for up to three years. The successful applicant will
examine the internal wave dissipation in global high-resolution ocean model simulations
conducted at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Global high-resolution internal tide and internal
gravity wave simulations have reached the point where the vertical profiles of internal wave
dissipation resemble the dissipation in observations. This postdoctoral position offers the
opportunity to make credible maps of internal wave dissipation on a global scale from model
simulations. This will be an important step forward in ocean modeling, because internal wave
dissipation impacts the overturning circulation, the distribution of carbon and other
biogeochemical elements, and more. The project provides opportunities to collaborate with
project scientists at the University of Southern Mississippi, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
(JPL), and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Furthermore, the NSF project is connected to
other NSF, ONR, and NASA-funded internal wave projects working under the umbrella of the
National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) on Global Internal Waves (https://nopp-
giw.ucsd.edu/). The postdoc will be encouraged to travel to NOPP meetings and other meetings
to present project results and network with other scientists. Residence in Ann Arbor, Michigan,
is preferred, but remote residence near our collaborating institutions in Stennis Space Center,
MS, Pasadena, CA, and Woods Hole, MA, or elsewhere will be considered especially for strong
applications.

The successful applicant should have a PhD in physical oceanography or a related field, and
strong skills in physics, math, and computing. Applicants should send a letter of interest,
curriculum vitae, including a list of publications and presentations, and contact information for
three references to Dr. Brian Arbic (arbic@umich.edu). Applications will be considered until the
position is filled, with a preferred start date in early 2024.

The University of Michigan offers competitive salary and benefits packages for postdoctoral
scientists. My lab is committed to recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce and we
encourage all employees to incorporate their diverse backgrounds, skills, and life experiences
into their work. The University of Michigan is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.
