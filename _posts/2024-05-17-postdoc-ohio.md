The Polar and Environmental Geochemistry Lab (Polar ENV) at The Ohio State University School of Earth Sciences and Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center invites applications for a Post Doctoral Scholar to join our team within the area of Ocean Worlds research. The candidate will work on a NASA-funded project focused on understanding geochemical cycling at the ice-ocean interface in the Arctic and Antarctica using remote sensing, laboratory measurements, and field data. The candidate will be based at OSU, but will have opportunities to work directly with co-investigators at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and NASA Jet Propulsion Lab. The targeted start date is June 3rd, 2024.

Qualifications:

Required: PhD in Geosciences or a related field.  Knowledge of Arctic and/or Antarctic environments.

Desired: Experience with aqueous geochemistry instrumentation, specifically ion chromatography, colorimetric continuous flow nutrient analysis, and/or ICP-MS. Previous (or interest in gaining) experience with X-CT and remote sensing.  Geochemical or geophysical data analysis using R, Matlab, Python, or similar language. Excellent verbal and written communication skills.  Collaborative mentality towards research and mentorship.
