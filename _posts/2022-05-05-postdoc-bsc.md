The BSC Earth Sciences Department aims to hire a motivated and proactive climate modeller to support the development of the high-resolution (eddy and storm-resolving) global climate model IFS/NEMO.

The ideal candidate must have the ability to work autonomously, be able to discuss the initial requirements and implement them efficiently, as well as build and support the software developed. The candidate will
work closely with a number of external collaborators and be part of a team well-integrated in the Department.

The duties include:
- Contribute to the development, maintain and optimize the global climate model for different high-resolution configurations.
- Perform simulations for model tuning and evaluation.
- Assist in the post-processing of the model output to, among other things, evaluate the model quality and feed back to the model development process.
- Collaborate with groups within the department to support scientific application work and computational development.
- Guide colleagues in performing experiments with efficiency.
