**New open position at Imperial College London**

The successful candidate will use laboratory measurements to constrain the rate of air entrainment inside short-crested breaking waves and develop a parameterisation to estimate bubble-mediated component of ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide. Further details can be provided to interested candidates via email communication.

The initial post is for 1 year, with funds available to extend up to two years for candidates beginning in September/October 2021.
