Christina Ravelo and Beth Caissie will be co-supervising a post-doc at University of California Santa Cruz. This NSF-funded position will focus on sea ice reconstructions in the North Pacific (particularly the Bering Sea) during warm periods, specifically Marine Isotope Stage 5. We are looking for a candidate who either has diatom/microfossil/geochemical experience with marine sediment cores OR who has the coding and database management expertise to help us launch a web-based database of North Pacific paleoceanographic records (or maybe there is a unique person who can do both).

The job advertisement can be accessed here:
