The National Oceanography Centre is looking to expand its Satellite Oceanography capacity and currently recruiting (1) a new Principal Investigator in ocean remote sensing, and (2) a remote sensing scientist in GNSS-Reflectometry.

 

Both posts are permanent, based in Southampton (UK), but more flexible arrangements can be considered (e.g. remote work, from within the UK).
