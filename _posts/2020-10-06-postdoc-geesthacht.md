Compounding climatic and anthropogenic stressors challenge marine plankton and benthic organisms. Modelling the marine ecosystem can improve the yet poor understanding of the response to multiple stressors and create reliable scenarios that support decision making. The Postdoc position is expected to investigate dependencies of coupled pelagic and benthic food-webs on multiple drivers (e.g. warming, pollution and trawling) in the southern North Sea. You will further develop and run a coupled model system including trait-based ecosystem models on decadal time scales. The work builds on predecessor and ongoing studies and will be a central integral hub of the collaborative project Multiple Stressors on North Sea Life (MuSSeL) funded in the FONA/KÃœNO program by BMBF.
