The Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of British Columbia invites applications for a Postdoctoral Fellow in the field of zooplankton ecology and modelling. The successful applicant will conduct research as part of a collaborative group investigating and modelling phytoplankton and zooplankton ecology of the Salish Sea. The candidate will be expected to take a lead role in performing model - data comparisons to evaluate an existing coupled bio-physical model (SalishSeaCast with SMELT salishsea.eos.ubc.ca) in collaboration with zooplankton ecologists in Fisheries and Oceans, Canada and University of Washington. Once the model is evaluated, the candidate will use the model results to determine the drivers of seasonal and interannual variability in zooplankton in the Salish Sea to aid in understanding juvenile salmon survival.  In collaboration with modellers, the candidate will contribute to the development and testing of zooplankton model improvements. Other responsibilities include communications with partners, report preparation, presentation of results at conferences and the publication of research results in peer-reviewed, leading international journals.



Minimum Requirements: A Ph.D. in oceanography or a related field with both expertise in zooplankton ecology and a strong quantitative background. A broad understanding of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxonomic groups is required and knowledge of their life histories and ecologies, including relationships with physical processes is desirable. Programming knowledge with R, python or similar is required and experience handling large spatial data/results sets is preferred. Practice with comparisons using diverse data sets would be an asset; candidates with previous experience in evaluation of plankton models would be ideal. The candidate should have an excellent record of research competence demonstrated by publications in the peer-reviewed international scientific literature. The ideal candidate will be independent, self-motivated, collaborative, have excellent written communication skills, and be well organized. The position is for one-year, renewable for a second year. Preferred start dates are September-November 2020. Salary is dependent upon educational level and experience; the minimum salary is $57,000 per year plus benefits.



Applications, including a CV, copies of two relevant publications, and the names, e-mails and phone numbers of three referees should be sent to Dr. Susan Allen (sallen@eoas.ubc.ca). The application deadline is August 14, 2020 but will be extended if a suitable candidate has not been found.



UBC hires on the basis of merit and is strongly committed to equity and diversity within its community.  We especially welcome applications from visible minority group members, women, Aboriginal persons, persons with disabilities, persons of minority sexual orientations and gender identities, and others with the skills and knowledge to productively engage with diverse communities.  All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority.
