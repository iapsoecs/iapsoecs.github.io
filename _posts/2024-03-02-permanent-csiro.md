CSIRO has an ongoing opportunity for a Sea Level Research Scientist to join the team. We will provide relocation assistance and visa sponsorship for the successful candidate if required. Link to CSIRO website to apply: https://jobs.csiro.au/job-invite/95943/

Sea Level Research Scientist

    - Conduct sea level research contributing to climate change intelligence of national and global benefit
    - Research on global and regional sea-level projections, sea level budget closure, historical sea-level reconstruction, ocean/climate/earth system modelling for sea level applications, and sea-level fingerprint due to land ice melting
    - Join Australia’s national science agency! Work on projects of significant impact 

CSIRO undertakes pure and applied research within a project-based framework with staff participating in teams that deliver innovative science-based solutions to stakeholders. CSIRO’s Environment Business Unit (BU) brings together CSIRO’s strong capabilities in marine, atmospheric, water and terrestrial science disciplines under one team. The BU employs over 800 staff at 22 sites across the country with an annual budget of over $200m.

Sea-level Rise (SLR), a widely recognized indicator of anthropogenic climate change, demands comprehensive investigation by maintaining long-term observation networks, improving understanding of all contributing sea level processes, as well as building up modelling capability to simulate the evolution of those processes in the past and the future. Society needs reliable and detailed regional sea level information for comprehending past changes and making informed projections for the future. CSIRO is the leading entity in Australia and the Pacific region with the expertise to produce process-based sea-level projections. The future sea-level projection products developed by CSIRO have been utilized by over 20 countries.

As part of the Sea Level, Waves and Remote Sensing (SLWRS) Team, in the Climate Intelligence Research Program, CSIRO Environment, this role will play a pivotal role in understanding, observing, modelling and projecting sea level on both global and regional scales. You will carry out innovative sea level research development across research areas including (but not limited to) global and regional sea-level projections, sea level budget closure, historical sea-level reconstruction, ocean/climate/earth system modelling for sea level applications, and sea-level fingerprint due to land ice melting. Over time, you will be expected to build up capability by managing junior staff members and research projects, mentoring students and postdoctoral fellows. Additionally, you will engage actively with various stakeholders to share sea level research findings and raise public awareness of climate change issues, including SLR. 

Your duties will include:

    - Undertake global and regional sea level research, including but not limited to sea-level projection, sea level budget closure, sea-level reconstruction, ocean/climate/earth system modelling for sea level applications, and sea-level fingerprint due to land ice melting.
    - Run and analyse climate/ocean/earth system model experiments for sea level purposes, and/or set up regional high-resolution modelling to get better representation of dynamic sea level around Australia or other regions of interest.
    - Engage actively with Australian cryosphere modelling community to collaborate on studying impacts of polar ice sheets on global and Australian sea levels.
    - Develop and publish sea level relevant datasets to share publicly.
    - Communicate research findings actively via scientific publications and presentations, share research findings with the broader audience (such as non-experts and public), and engage with stakeholders.
    - Interact with international sea-level community proactively to play an active role in new developments and applications of sea level research, and ensure their benefits are realised in Australia.
    - Under guidance of more senior researchers, plan and draft research proposals and carry out research investigations, requiring originality, creativity and innovation.
    - Draw on professional expertise and research experience to recognise opportunities for innovation and generate new theoretical perspectives by pursuing new ideas/approaches and networking with scientific colleagues across a range of disciplines.

Location:  Hobart or Melbourne preferred, but Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth will be considered

Salary:  CSOF5: AU $105k to AU $114k pa (pro-rata for part-time) + up to 15.4% superannuation

  CSOF6: AU $121k to AU $142 pa (pro-rata for part-time) + up to 15.4% superannuation

  NB: This position is offered across two levels, the appointment level will be determined by the qualifications, skills and relevant experience of the successful candidate

Tenure:  Indefinite

Reference:  95943

To be considered you will need:

    - A PhD (or an equivalent combination of qualifications and research experience) in a relevant field such as physical oceanography, meteorology, geodesy, glaciology, and climate science. Note: This position is advertised across two levels. CSOF 5 is typically considered early career (at least 3 years of relevant research experience since obtaining PhD) and a CSOF 6 is considered mid-career (at least 6-10 years relevant research experience since obtaining PhD)
    - Well-developed expertise in sea level research, including but not limited to sea-level projection, sea-level budget closure, sea-level reconstruction, ocean/climate/earth system modelling for sea level applications, sea-level fingerprint, historical sea level monitoring based on in-situ and satellite observations.
    - Outstanding track record in either running ocean/climate/earth system models for sea level applications or analysing existing large-size modelling output such as various World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) related to sea level research.
    - Demonstrated ability to undertake original, creative, and innovative research by generating and pursuing novel ideas and solutions to complex scientific research problems.
    - Proven track record of publishing scientific papers in leading peer-reviewed journals.
    - High level communication skills with the ability to represent the research team effectively internally and externally, including presentation of research outcomes at national and international conferences.
