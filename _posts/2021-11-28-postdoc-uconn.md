JOB SUMMARY

The coastal biogeochemical dynamics lab in the Department of the Marine Sciences located on the Avery Point campus at the University of Connecticut invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher. The successful candidate will advance our understanding of the predictability of biogeochemical fields on seasonal to interannual timescales. This position will provide an opportunity to advance the understanding of the controls over regionally predictability of biogeochemical fields as well as their application to fisheries management. You will work on developing models, analyzing output, and delivering the relevant information to coastal communities who rely on this information for planning and decision-making.  Visit our lab website (https://samanthasiedlecki.wixsite.com/coastalbiogeodynlab <https://samanthasiedlecki.wixsite.com/coastalbiogeodynlab>) for more information about our research. The position will also enable the postdoctoral scholar the opportunity to collaborate with scientists at NOAA.  The successful candidate will have a working knowledge of ocean biogeochemical cycling including carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycles in coastal environments, expertise in programming and large data set analysis, as well as model evaluation. Preference will be given to candidates with experience running ROMS models.  The position will be located at the regional campus at Avery Point working predominately with the laboratory of Samantha Siedlecki.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Run simulations using a regional modeling framework like ROMS for the coastal ocean equipped with biogeochemistry
Analyze model output and evaluate model performance using existing observational data;
Quantify regional predictability of model fields on various timescales
Publish research in peer-reviewed journals and present results at national and international conferences.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

Doctoral degree in Oceanography, or a closely related field
Technical training or practical experience in programming (Python, Matlab or similar)
Exposure to ocean biogeochemical cycling including carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycles through courses or research experience
Experience with ROMS modeling
Ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment
Excellent written and oral communication skills
Ability to pursue research independently

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS

Experience with biogeochemical model analysis and evaluation or large observational data set equivalent
Demonstrated experience mentoring graduate or undergraduate students
Publications related to the minimum qualifications
Research experience with forecasts or projections

APPOINTMENT TERMS

The initial appointment is for one year, with the possibility of renewal based on performance and funding.  Salary and benefits are competitive.
