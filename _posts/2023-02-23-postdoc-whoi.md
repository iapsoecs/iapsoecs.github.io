Join us for innovative radiocarbon research at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (NOSAMS) seeks a Postdoctoral Investigator focused on advancing the ever-growing utility of radiocarbon analyses to address emerging research questions in oceanography and the geosciences. The appointment would be for a period of two years.



The NOSAMS facility is dedicated to advancing radiocarbon measurement capabilities and scientific research (www.whoi.edu/nosams<http://www.whoi.edu/nosams>). A wide range of instrumentation, including a recently installed Mini Carbon Dating System (MICADAS),  provides unique opportunities for compound-specific, high throughput, and high precision applications. Of particular interest are candidates whose research would address one or more of the following areas: (i) modeling of dissolved inorganic carbon isotopes in conjunction with Scientific Staff in the Physical Oceanography department, to investigate the oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2 and changes in large scale ocean circulation (ii) establishing and optimizing a method for the analysis of the isotopes of methane (14C, 13C) from aqueous sample (iii) studies of radiocarbon in oceanic systems and (iv) developments in accelerator mass spectrometry and related techniques.



WHOI has a top-rated postdoctoral program (https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/educate/postdoctoral/) that supports a dynamic, diverse postdoctoral community with formal mentoring and career guidance programs. While the primary focus of the work will be in research, the Postdoctoral Investigator will have the opportunity to participate in educational and outreach activities associated with the project.



Online application forms should be submitted with a cover letter and full curriculum vitae including the contact details for three references. Review of applications will begin immediately and applicants will be considered until the position is filled. Informal inquiries may be made by email to Roberta Hansman (rhansman@whoi.edu), Mark Roberts (mroberts@whoi.edu), or Susan Lang (sqlang@whoi.edu).
