The Climate and Coastal Ecosystem Lab at the University of British Columbia
in Vancouver, Canada is searching for a postdoctoral researcher to
participate in research on drivers of ocean extreme events and their
effects on coastal ecosystems. Our research group
(https://simondonner.com/lab-team/)
led by Prof. Simon Donner
(https://simondonner.com),
conducts interdisciplinary research at the intersection of climate science,
marine science and policy.

Periods of anomalously warm sea surface temperatures, often termed marine
heatwaves, attributed to human-caused climate change have caused mass
mortality and phase shifts in coastal ecosystems. In addition to other
areas of climate research
(https://simondonner.com/research/),
people in our group have studied the drivers of marine heatwaves and their
effects on coral reef and kelp systems at the global scale using
large-scale numerical modelling and data analysis, and also in the
equatorial Pacific (e.g., Republic of Kiribati, Galápagos Archipelago)
using field surveys.

The new postdoctoral researcher would focus on one or more project(s)
related to i) temporal dynamics of warm-season marine heatwaves in the
equatorial Pacific, ii) assessing and projecting the effect of compound
climate extremes on coastal ecosystems using available databases, iii)
changing baselines for estimating heat stress on coastal ecosystems.

*Qualifications*: Applicants must have PhD in climate science,
oceanography, or a related marine science field, experience with
large-scale numerical modelling and data analysis (i.e., Matlab, Python and
Linux shell scripting), and a demonstrated interest in interdisciplinary
research spanning the fields of coastal ecology, oceanography and climate
science. Expertise in coral reef or kelp ecosystems is an asset. The ideal
candidate is a rigourous, self-motivated scientist with excellent
analytical and communication skills who will thrive working with a diverse
and interdisciplinary group of researchers.

*Position Details*: This is a full-time two-year position with the
potential to extend to a third year depending on funding. The annual salary
starts at $60,000 CAD per year. UBC offers postdocs
(https://www.postdocs.ubc.ca/)
a wide-ranging benefits plan that includes extended health and dental
coverage. Postdocs are encouraged to apply for external funding to support
their independent research building on this position within the research
group.

*Application Instructions*: Please email simon.donner@ubc.ca with the title
“CCEL Postdoctoral Position” and the following materials:

   - body of e-mail:
      - brief description of your background, career vision and fit to the
      position
      - one or two specific research questions you’d like to address within
      the above topics
      - the methods you would use to answer the question(s)
   - names and contact information of two professional references
   - a copy of your latest CV
   - one representative sample of your research (for which you are lead
   author)


Applicants will hear back within three weeks if there is a potential fit.
