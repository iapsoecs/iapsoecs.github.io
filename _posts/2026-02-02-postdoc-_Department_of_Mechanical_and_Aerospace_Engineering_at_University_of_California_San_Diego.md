## Postdoctoral Fellowship: Machine learning based ocean state estimation for aquaculture and mCDR applications

The Environmental Fluid Dynamics Lab in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at
UCSD invites applications for a postdoctoral fellowship funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
focused on the topic of machine learning-based ocean state estimation to begin in Spring/Summer 2026.
The successful applicant will develop and implement data-driven tools, underpinned by scientific machine
learning and reduced-order modeling, for ocean state estimation with quantified uncertainties. The central
aim is to increase the efficiency and accuracy of near-field prediction of physical and biological conditions
for marine operations including marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) and aquaculture. The ideal
candidate will have experience in two or three of the focal areas: data driven modeling, scientific machine
learning or coastal ocean physics; and will have an interest in applying these towards ocean applications.
The position will also include collaborative work with investigators at partner institutions.
Additional information about postdoctoral positions at UCSD and benefits can be found on the UCSD Office
of Postdoctoral and Research Scholar website.

# DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITES

- Develop and apply reduced-order modeling approaches using spatiotemporal decompositions of large
high-resolution simulation datasets.
- Develop and train machine learning architectures using reduced-order predictions together with
heterogeneous observational data.
- Integrate data driven methods into a framework for uncertainty-aware ocean state estimation.
- Apply and validate the framework using datasets at experimental sites.
- Publish research in peer-reviewed journals and present results at national and international conferences;
- Mentor graduate and undergraduate students in the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Lab.

# MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

- Doctoral degree in engineering, oceanography or a related field, with relevant background in data-driven
modeling, machine learning and/or fluid mechanics;
- Experience in numerical fluid dynamics or ocean model application, validation and analysis;
- Ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment;
- Excellent written and oral communication skills;
- Publication record in peer-reviewed journals related to the minimum qualifications;
- Ability to pursue research independently.

The postdoc will work directly with Dr. Geno Pawlak Tejada (https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/efdlab),
Boris Kramer (https://kramer.ucsd.edu) and Oliver Schmidt (https://flowphysics.ucsd.edu) at the
Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and will also collaborate with co-investigators at
Stanford University. Additionally, there will be opportunities to mentor graduate and undergraduate
students. The initial appointment will be for two years with possible extension, subject to performance and
availability of funding. The total duration of an individual’s postdoctoral service may not exceed five years,
including postdoctoral service at other institutions. Salary will commensurate with qualifications and
experience and with the UCSD Postdoc Salary Scale. (https://postdoc.ucsd.edu/postdocs/index.html)

To apply: email Geno Pawlak Tejada (pawlak@ucsd.edu) with a cover letter, CV, and contact information
for 3 references. Screening of applicants will begin immediately and will continue until the position is filled,
however for full consideration, please email your application file before Mar 1, 2026.
