The University of Hamburg invites applications for a PhD position in Physical Oceanography. The successful candidate will be part of the “Theoretical Oceanography” group at the Institute of Oceanography. The position is related to subproject “T2: Ocean Surface Layer Energetics”, which contributes to the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) TRR 181 “Energy Transfers in Atmosphere and Ocean” (https://www.trr-energytransfers.de/). The T2 subproject aims to understand the dynamics of the oceanic surface mixed layer. Within this layer, processes from different dynamical regimes (e.g., small-scale turbulence, submesoscales, and surface waves) generate a variety of energy transfer mechanisms.

This position will focus on submesoscales, a recently discovered dynamical regime that is important for the energetics and dynamics of the surface layer but is currently poorly understood. The successful candidate will use a high-resolution numerical modeling approach and available observations to evaluate the model results. The candidate will be part of the research training group “Energy” which offers dedicated training courses, seminars, spring schools, mentoring, and, if desired, international research visits.
