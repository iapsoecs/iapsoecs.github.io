The Bolin Centre for Climate Research is dedicated to create and disseminate knowledge about the Earth's climate system and its interactions with the environment, both past and present.

The Bolin Centre for Climate Research is a unique collaboration between several departments at Stockholm University (SU), the FLOW centre at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and the Rossby Centre at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). The partners at SU include the Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences (DEEP), Department of Environmental Science, Department of Geological Sciences (IGV), Department of Meteorology (MISU), Department of Physical Geography (NG), and Department of Zoology. Since its formation in 2006, the Centre has brought together experts to extend and disseminate knowledge about climate processes, modelling, and human impacts. This includes providing career opportunities for a diverse community of climate researchers, and creating a research environment that sustains their further development.

Bolin Centre is pleased to announce new opportunities as part of “Bolin post-doctoral fellow” program. The call is broad, and candidates can freely choose a research theme within the Centre. We encourage applications that involve several departments and interdisciplinary activities.

**Project description**

The call is very broad and spans all of our four Research Themes (RTs):

RT 1 – The physical-chemical climate system

RT 2 – Water, biogeochemistry and climate

RT 3 – Past climates

RT 4 – Climate, ecosystems and biodiversity

Candidates are encouraged to submit an individual research plan, and in developing one the candidate is expected to link their proposed research to at least one of the Bolin Centre RTs. During the recruitment process, contacts between the successful candidate(s) and 2-3 Bolin scientists acting as potential mentors of the fellows will be established. If the applicants wish to do so, they can identify potential mentors already in their application, but this is not expected or necessary. The successful candidates will eventually agree on the details of their project with the host institution. Up to 4 postdoctoral fellows will be chosen.
