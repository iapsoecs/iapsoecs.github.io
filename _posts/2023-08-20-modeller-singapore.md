**What the role is**

The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) is a division of the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). At CCRS, our mission is to advance scientific understanding of tropical climate variability and change and its associated weather systems affecting Singapore and the wider Southeast Asia region, so that the knowledge and expertise can benefit decision makers and the community. Our vision is to be a world leading centre in tropical climate and weather research focussing on the Southeast Asia region.

Within CCRS, the Department for Weather Research (DWR) leads the research and development (R&D) of our core tropical, convective-scale ‘SINGV’ modelling system for both weather and climate change applications. DWR also undertakes R&D and oversees the transition to operations of SINGV-based local numerical weather prediction (NWP), marine and haze/air quality forecasting with lead times up to a week ahead. The DWR works closely with CCRS’s Department of Climate Research (DCR) and High Performance Computing (HPC) Branch, MSS forecasters, local universities, and a number of international organisations including the UK Met Office, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and US National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Since 2022, CCRS has been a core member of the international Unified Model (UM) partnership.

The DWR Core Modelling Development (CMD) branch is responsible for developing CCRS’s core SINGV modelling capabilities, with a focus on the representation of the underlying physical and dynamical processes governing weather and climate in Southeast Asian region. The CMD branch works closely with other CCRS branches to further evaluate the core SINGV system in specific weather and climate change applications, and with local agencies and institutes of higher learning to share research outcomes and further develop advanced modelling system applications for the region.

This new position will undertake marine-based climate research to further enhance CCRS high resolution regional Southeast Asia marine modelling capabilities based on km-scale configurations of the Nucleus for Environmental Modelling (NEMO) system. Target applications for this work include contributing to the development of CCRS’ coupled ‘cSINGV’ atmosphere-land-ocean-wave capability for application in environmental prediction (i.e. weather/ocean/wave forecasting) as well as CCRS’ next-generation ‘V4’ regional climate projections, providing improved estimates of changes in the marine environment and local sea level rise.

 

**What you will be working on**

The specific job responsibilities of this position include:

    Keeping abreast of the latest R&D in the areas of high-resolution marine and coupled ocean-atmosphere modelling for weather and climate application.
    Further developing, evaluating, and improving cSINGV coupled model capabilities, focusing on the representation of marine and ocean processes in NEMO.
    Applying marine and coupled models to explore and improve the fundamental processes governing the weather and climate in the region.
    Publishing research outcomes in peer-reviewed publications and presenting findings at international meetings.
    Working with local and international institutes to cultivate relevant research collaborations.
    Communicating research findings to relevant stakeholders through verbal briefings and reports, and to the international scientific community through conference presentations.

What we are looking for

    PhD degree (or equivalent) in atmospheric or marine sciences, fluid dynamics or a related field.
    At least 3 years of research experience in an area of high-resolution ocean or coupled ocean-atmosphere modelling, and/or applying such models in weather and climate research.
    High level of proficiency in scientific programming (e.g., Fortran, Python) and experience of using HPC.
    Familiarity with the regional modelling suites of Met Office’s Unified Model and/or the NEMO ocean model is desirable.
    Excellent communication skills both written and verbal and across technical and non-technical materials, with publications in peer-reviewed journals are desirable.
    Experience working as part of a multi-disciplinary, diverse scientific team
    Ability to work effectively to deadlines on individual projects and as part of a diverse team.
    Interest and passion to deliver relevant R&D for societal benefits.
    Ability to network effectively with the local and international research community.
