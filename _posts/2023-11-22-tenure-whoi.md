The Department of Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (http://www.whoi.edu/) (WHOI) invites candidates to apply to the open full-time tenure track position on our scientific staff. We seek to hire 1-2 scientists at any of the Assistant/Associate/Senior Scientist levels in the area of Ocean Acoustics with the potential to complement or diversify existing strengths and become the next wave of ocean acoustics leadership.

Of interest are all aspects of fundamental and applied ocean acoustics.

We seek broad-thinking applicants committed to developing a vigorous sea-going program involving innovative technologies and sustainable ocean observing solutions. We envision acoustics as being a keystone component in making the oceans more transparent and connected, with implications for sustainable ocean resources, observatory infrastructure, resiliency, national defense, climate, environmental stewardship, and marine policy. The ideal candidate will develop a research program that contributes significantly to the WHOI Vision 2030, which envisions a decade of institutional investment in excellence, innovation, and global engagement. We seek individuals utilizing and developing state-of-the-art technology to provide fundamental scientific advances on the ocean and its connection with the Earth system and inform use-inspired outcomes. We invite expansive interpretations of our research, teaching, and scholarly pursuits and welcome interdisciplinary approaches.

WHOI is located on Cape Cod in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, a world-renowned center of excellence in marine, biomedical, and environmental science, with proximity to the research hubs of Boston, MA and Providence, RI. Its mission is to advance our understanding of the ocean and its interaction with the Earth system, and to communicate this understanding for the benefit of society. WHOI is the largest private, non-profit oceanographic institution in the world, with staff and students numbering approximately 1,000. Together with an additional ~500 affiliated personnel associated with the scientific endeavors of the Institution, WHOI is home to a vibrant scientific community that has a strong international component.

WHOI offers a comprehensive benefit package that includes but is not limited to relocation assistance, medical and dental plans, childcare subsidy, housing assistance, tuition assistance, an employer contribution retirement plan, vacation time, flexible scheduling, and family illness days.

Tenure-track staff are positions equivalent to ladder-rank professorial posts and tenure-track group leader positions.

Essential Functions

WHOI Scientific Staff members develop externally-funded and internationally recognized research programs. Many also advise graduate students and teach courses in the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science and Engineering. Scientific Staff also have access to significant internal funding opportunities, including exciting new directions through WHOI?s Vision 2030 Initiative (https://www.whoi.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WHOI.Vision.2030.pdf). These internal funding opportunities ensure that all scientists have full salary support. Newly hired Scientific Staff receive start-up packages as they develop their independent research portfolios. Scientific Staff are encouraged (although not required) to embark on interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial ventures as well as develop collaborations within the Institution, its various Centers (https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/understand/departments-centers-labs/), and the Woods Hole community.
