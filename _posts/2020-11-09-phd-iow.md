There is an opening for a 3-year PhD position in Physical Oceanography 
at the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research IOW, in collaboration 
with the Max Planck Institute for meteorology (application deadline is 
20 November 2020): 
<https://www.io-warnemuende.de/tl_files/news/stellenausschreibungen/2020/en_Phy-10-2020-wiss-mit-20201030.pdf>


The research will focus on the impact of ocean near-surface turbulent 
processes for the atmosphere-ocean coupling in climate models. This PhD 
project is embedded in a large-scale project cluster, in which numerous 
universities and research institutes collaborate towards the development 
of the next generation of energy consistent climate models.
