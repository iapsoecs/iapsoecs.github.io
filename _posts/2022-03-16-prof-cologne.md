The University of Cologne* has opened a call for:

Professorship Data Assimilation in Geosciences (W2) (f/m/d)

YOUR TASKS

The successful candidate (f/m/d) will be expected to contribute to research, teaching and academic administration in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, in particular in the Department of Geosciences. Research should target advancing the understanding of the coupled earth system by novel data assimilation approaches and be embedded into the Center for Earth System Observations and Computational Analysis (CESOC). The involvement of partners from operational applications, e.g. the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) at its new location in Bonn and the German Weather Service is desired. For the latter, close cooperation with the Hans-Ertel Centre for Weather Research (HErZ) is beneficial. Teaching in the Bachelor and Master programmes of the Department is expected especially in the Master programmes “Computational Sciences” and “Physics of the Earth and Atmosphere”.

YOUR PROFILE

We are seeking an outstanding academic (f/m/d) with demonstrated international experience in areas of earth system models and earth observation. Specific research topics could be numerical weather forecasting, climate monitoring/reanalysis, paleo climate or any other geoscientific applications. A strong mathematical and physical background in data assimilation is expected. The successful candidate (f/m/d) is interested in interdisciplinary research, has already worked in collaborative research projects, contributes to excellent teaching, and is willing to participate in the development of new teaching programmes.

OUR OFFER 

The University of Cologne provides a stimulating interdisciplinary academic environment. Especially, the Center for Data and Simulation Science (CDS), the competence area: Quantitative Modeling of Complex Systems, the Geoverbund ABC/J and the expanding computer science division offer many exciting opportunities for cooperation. The university offers a wide range of career development opportunities as well as support services for dual career couples and family- friendly working conditions. The position is available as of at the earliest possible date. Formal requirements are detailed in Section 36 of the Higher Education Act of North Rhine-Westphalia (Hochschulgesetz – HG NRW). As a rule, the teaching load comprises nine semester hours per week (i.e., two hours per week is one 90-minute course per semester). The University of Cologne is committed to equal opportunities and diversity. Women are especially encouraged to apply and will be considered preferentially in accordance with the Equal Opportunities Act of North Rhine Westphalia (Landesgleichstellungsgesetz – LGG NRW). We also expressly welcome applications from people with disabilities / special needs or of equal status.

Please submit your application via the University of Cologne’s Academic Job Portal (https://professorships.uni-koeln.de) by 04.04.2022. Your application should be addressed to the Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Applications should include a letter of motivation with teaching and research statements accompanied by supporting documents (CV, complete publication list highlighting the 5 most important publications, teaching evaluations if available, information on external funding, academic achievements and honours).
