The Gulf of Maine Research Institute (https://gmri.org/) (GMRI) is seeking
qualified candidates to establish a new research group that investigates
climate-zooplankton-upper trophic interactions across spatial and temporal
scales in the Gulf of Maine and adjacent Large Marine Ecosystems. The
incumbent will work collaboratively with physical oceanographers, coastal
ecologists, fisheries scientists, climate-ecosystem researchers, and
socio-economic scientists to apply results to fisheries management, natural
and social ecosystem assessments, and marine and coastal businesses
throughout the regional Blue Economy. The incumbent will play a critical
role in: 1) improving our understanding of the mechanistic relationships
between zooplankton distribution, production, and community dynamics to
fisheries recruitment and upper trophic level population variability; 2)
determining the mechanisms that relate physical oceanography, primary
producers, and zooplankton; 3) the role of top-down dynamics on plankton
productivity, and 4) assessing the magnitude and direction of the response
of Gulf of Maine and North Atlantic zooplankton communities to drivers of
climate change.


This position is a full-time (100% FTE), 9-month salaried position located
in Portland, Maine.


Salary Range: $88,900 - $159,900
