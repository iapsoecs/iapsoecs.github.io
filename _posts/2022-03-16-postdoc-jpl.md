Job Title: Scientist, Sea Level
Location: Pasadena, CA

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, invites applications for a newly created research position in the Sea Level and Ice Group. The research will involve studying sea level change and impacts occurring at the coast. The scientist will combine in situ observations with available satellite observations, which requires a broad understanding of the observational network at the coast. This will include working on integrating observations from recent and future missions including Sentinel-6/Michael Freilich, SWOT and NISAR. The successful applicant will further apply improved knowledge of coastal sea level with research in other disciplines to make assessments of future coastal impacts. Similarly, the ability to engage in interdisciplinary research to address the coastal impacts that cut across different fields of study is highly desired. The focus is not just on sea level science and impacts, but also encompasses how sea level is connected to changes occurring across the land-ocean interface. Finally, the scientist will engage with partners and practitioners to understand sea-level related needs, formulate research and application activities to meet these needs, and implement solutions that ultimately lead to societal benefit. Applicants that focus on one or a subset of the areas above would also be responsive to this opportunity.

This position requires the following qualifications:

  *   PhD in Oceanography, Physics, Engineering or other relevant Earth Science discipline.
  *   A knowledge of coastal science, oceanography, modeling of geodynamics problems as well as an understanding of contemporary problems in geomorphology and sea-level analysis.
  *   Good oral (including public speaking) and written communication skills.

The following qualifications are preferred:

  *   Some knowledge of the goals of NASA's missions for Sentinel-6/Michael Freilich, SWOT, NISAR, GRACE, GRACE-FO, and IceSat-2, along with the objectives of the NASA Sea-Level Change Team.
  *   Demonstrated previous engagement or interest in working with practitioners and decision-makers for the purposes of support sea-level planning and decision-making.
  *   Demonstrated professional reputation as a productive researcher with a track record of publications in peer-reviewed journals, and presentations at national and/or international conferences.
