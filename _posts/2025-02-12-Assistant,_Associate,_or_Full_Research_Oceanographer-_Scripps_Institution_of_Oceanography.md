## POSITION DESCRIPTION

The Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) at the University of California San Diego invites applications for a full-time Researcher in the Oceans and Atmosphere Section. We seek a motivated, broad-thinking scientist to develop a vigorous research group and provide intellectual leadership in their field while complementing existing expertise in the Oceans and Atmosphere Section. The Researcher series at SIO parallels the Professor series in terms of independent research and service, but it carries no teaching requirements. Researchers receive 25% of their annual salary support from institutional sources. Researchers are expected to establish an externally funded research program that provides the remainder of their salary support. Researchers at SIO often serve as undergraduate and graduate student advisors.

SIO has a long history of research excellence at the forefront of large-scale observational oceanography, from WOCE to the US GO-SHIP program to Argo. We are seeking candidates excited to continue the tradition of excellence in large-scale ocean observations and who are qualified to take on a leadership role in the US GO-SHIP program, with level of leadership commensurate with career level. The successful candidate will have expertise in sea-going oceanography, with an emphasis on research conducted with hydrographic observations including, but not limited to, circulation and water properties, ocean and climate, carbon systems, and/or transient tracers. Additional salary support for the successful candidate could be available through the US GO-SHIP program. The successful candidate will also have demonstrated a commitment to building an equitable and diverse scholarly environment. We are open to hiring at the Assistant, Associate, or Full Researcher levels.

SIO is a world-renowned center of marine research with approximately 200 principal investigators leading research programs on all aspects of earth, ocean, biological, and atmospheric sciences. SIO is dedicated to advancing belonging, accessibility, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (BAJEDI) for all who are or wish to be members of our community. We welcome candidates who have had non-traditional career paths or who have taken time off for family reasons, or who have achieved excellence in careers outside academia. Information about SIO’s ongoing diversity efforts may be found here: https://scripps.ucsd.edu/diversity. Successful candidates must demonstrate a commitment to promoting and contributing to BAJEDI in SIO’s educational, research, and work environments.
