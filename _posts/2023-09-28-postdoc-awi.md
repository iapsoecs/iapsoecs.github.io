Within my Emmy-Noether Young Investigator Group I am seeking to fill another PhD position in the field of "Snow modelling on Antarctic sea ice".

The PhD project aims to quantify the temporal evolution of internal snow properties and to describe the governing processes on all scales for the Antarctic sea ice cover. A comprehensive observational snow data set will be used to prescribe baseline conditions for the snow cover and to adapt the snow model SnowModel for Antarctic sea ice conditions. The candidate will have the opportunity to participate in a ship-based expedition to gain hands-on experience in related sea ice and snow work.

More details on the tasks and requirements can be found here: https://jobs.awi.de/Vacancies/1497/Description/2

The project is embedded in my Young Investigator and Bridge Group between the Alfred Wegener Institute and the University of Hamburg, with the option to work at either or both locations.

The deadline for applications is 18 October 2023, with a preferred start date no later than March 2024.

Please feel free to consider and/or share the job announcement to potential candidates in your areas.

Thanks for your support and best wishes,

Stefanie Arndt
