# Three-year post-doctoral scientist position at the UCLouvain, Belgium, on the Atlantic Ocean circulation over the past two millennia

The position is open within the project ‘Atlantic Ocean Circulation over the Past Two Millennia and its Impact on European Climate (AMOC-Millennia)’ supported by the FNRS, Belgium and DFG, Germany.

The goal of the project is to investigate AMOC and other ocean circulation variability within the context of climatic changes over the past two millennia, combining information from proxy data and climate models using data assimilation techniques. A better understanding of changes over the last millennia is critical to put the modern variations in perspective. This would also allow reducing the uncertainty in predicting future ocean circulation changes, as the extent of future AMOC weakening, and their potential impacts.

In this framework, applications are open for the following position:

Post-doctoral researcher

Starting date: Ideally in June 2025 but can be negotiated
Full time position for 36 months

Net monthly salary: 2900-3300 € (depending on seniority)

Social insurance and the transportation to and from the workplace are also covered.
Location: Earth and Life Institute, Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium.

Frequent interactions with the partner institution (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, PIK, Potsdam Germany ) are expected.

The candidates must not have spent more than 2 years in Belgium over the last 3 years and should not have obtained their PhD more than 6 years before the starting date of the grant.

The post-doctoral scientist will be responsible for the selection of proxy data over the North Atlantic basin, the Arctic and surrounding continents from existing data bases and for the development of the protocol for the model-data comparison, including the application of proxy system models. This data set will then be used to perform a reconstruction of the variability of the oceanic circulation over the past two millennia using offline and online data assimilation. The drivers and influence of this variability, in particular on European climate, will be then investigated.

Required qualifications:

- To have a PhD in data science, climatology or related field;
- To have strong experience in programming and in managing large data sets;
- To have published in peer-reviewed international journals;
- To have demonstrated good verbal and written communication skills in English;
- To have interest in working in a multidisciplinary team environment.

Previous experience in climate modelling is an asset.

Applicants should send an e-mail to Hugues Goosse (hugues.goosse@uclouvain.be) including (i) a statement of research experience, qualification and interest, (ii) a complete CV including a list of publications, and (iii) the name of two scientists who would agree to send a letter of recommendation

Review of the applications will start March 5 and the call will remain open until the position is filled.
