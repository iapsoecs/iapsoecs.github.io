The University of Washington (UW) and Western Washington University (WWU) are recruiting a postdoc and at least one MS student to work on an NSF-supported project exploring mid-Pliocene marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the North Pacific via trace metal variability in individual foraminifera.

The postdoc will be based in the School of Oceanography at UW in Seattle, and will work in the TraceLab (http://depts.washington.edu/tracelab/). Research will involve refining ICP-MS isotope-dilution methods and generating paleotemperature distributions based on element/calcium ratios of individual G. bulloides foraminifera. An initial 12 month appointment is renewable for up to 2.5 years. For more information, or to apply, please see this link: https://apply.interfolio.com/118213. Application deadline is December 23, 2022.

The MS position(s) will be based at WWU in Bellingham in the Geology Department. Research will focus on calibrating element/calcium ratios to observed MHWs and applying those calibrations to mid-Pliocene samples at a given core location to reconstruct past MHW behavior. For more information on WWU and the Geology graduate program please see these links: https://geology.wwu.edu/, https://gradschool.wwu.edu/geology. Application deadline is January 15.

Both positions will work closely with each other and Drs. Casey Saenger and Alex Gagnon.

Please contact Casey (saengec@wwu.edu<mailto:saengec@wwu.edu>) with questions, or find him at AGU.
