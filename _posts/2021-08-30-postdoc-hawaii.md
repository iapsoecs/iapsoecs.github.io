Postdoctoral Scholar in Regional Ocean Climate Forecasts of Hawaii

A three-year postdoctoral scholar position is available to join the Powell Lab ( https://powellb.oceanmodeling.org/ ) in the Department of Oceanography in the School of Ocean and Earth Science Technology at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa. You will join an effort to downscale global climate projections to sub-mesoscale resolving scales around the Hawaiian islands to study the impacts of climate change on physics, ocean acidification, and more. These efforts will be extended by working to develop a new regional model using MOM6 along with ROMS. In addition, we will be developing machine-learning techniques to downscale global forcing products to the islands.

The successful candidate will join a dynamic lab environment working on similar issues and research. The position will be responsible for developing new downscaling techniques, working with the national MOM6 team to improve regional capabilities, performing regional climate projections, participating in local and national working groups, and performing scientific analysis of the results. It is expected that the successful candidate will publish scientific articles and will have opportunities to contribute to and/or write new funding proposals to develop their own program. Competitive candidates may come from a domain-specific background (oceanography) or a technique specific background (numerical modeling). We will consider applicants of  nontraditional and tangential fields with motivation and interest in becoming machine learning experts within oceanography.

Minimum Qualifications include: Ph.D. or equivalent in physical oceanography, physics, mathematics, ocean engineering, or related field, ability to work well independently as part of a team, and strong communication skills both verbal and written. Preferred candidates will have strong mathematical and computational skills with a background in fluids, or physical oceanography. Candidates should be motivated to drive new developments in models and machine learning within oceanography.

The appointment will be reviewed annually and renewed based upon performance and funding. Salary is commensurate with qualifications and experience. Review of applications will begin Sept. 17, 2021. Electronic applications can be submitted to:
