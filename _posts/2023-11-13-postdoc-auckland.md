We are searching for a Postdoctoral Research Associate to join the APOG Group www.polar-oceans.org  and the Scale Aware Sea Ice Projects (https://sasip-climate.github.io/) efforts to understand polar change.

 

The scientist will join a growing cohort of polar scientists and oceanographers working between the University of Auckland and Brown University. The successful applicant will investigate precipitation change across Antarctica across a range of different datasets including reanalysis, satellites and high resolution climate models to assess future stability of the ice sheet.

 

The position will be held at the University of Auckland but directly supported by a broad team from Brown University with project collaborators in Norway and France. The applicant selected will have leeway for scientific exploration and self-directed research.

 

The proposed start date in 1/1/24 for at least one year with the possibility of an extension. Additional research and travel support is allocated to facilitate this work.

 

Apply with a CV, 1 page cover letter/research statement, and contact information for three references to michelle.mccrystall@auckland.ac.nz.  The closing date for applications is December 1st 2023. The position will remain open until filled.
