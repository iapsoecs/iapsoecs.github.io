POSTDOCTORAL/RESEARCH SCIENTISTS

ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES

PRINCETON UNIVERSITY/GFDL

In collaboration with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University solicits applications to its Postdoctoral Research Scientist Program funded by the Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES).

The AOS Program and GFDL offer a stimulating and supportive environment with significant computational and intellectual resources in which to conduct collaborative or independent research for the modeling, understanding and predictability of the Earth System from weather to centennial time scales. We primarily seek applications from recent Ph.D.s for postdoctoral positions but will accept applications from more experienced researchers. Appointments are made at the rank of Postdoctoral Research Associate, or more senior, initially for one year with the possibility of renewal for a second year based on satisfactory performance and continued funding. A competitive salary is offered commensurate with experience and qualifications.

We seek applications in all areas of earth system science within the three research themes of CIMES: 1) Earth System Modeling; 2) Seamless prediction across time and space scales; 3) Earth System Science: Analysis and Applications. The broad scope is improved representation of processes in models, high-resolution modeling, and advancing the understanding of the Earth System including its variations, changes, feedbacks, and sensitivity utilizing models and observations. Current areas of particular interest are: Stratosphere-troposphere radiative-chemical-dynamical interactions, and predictability; Aerosol-cloud-precipitation-radiation interactions including ice and mixed-phase microphysics, and effects on weather and climate; Lower atmosphere-surface interactions over land and ocean; Land surface processes and atmospheric precursors of risks; Ocean dynamics and its role in climate, and impacts on coastal regions and marine resources; Subseasonal to seasonal predictions of high-impact weather events; Decadal projections of regional climate and extremes using large high-resolution climate model ensembles; Detection and causal attribution of climate change; Applications of novel machine learning methods; Downscaling techniques to address regional climate and weather impacts.

and about GFDL from

Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact potential hosts at GFDL and/or Princeton University prior to application to discuss areas of possible research.

Complete applications, including a CV, copies of recent publications, three letters of recommendation, and a research proposal of approximately 5 pages including the project title, should be submitted by December 8th, 2020 for full consideration.  A goal of our department is diversifying the community of scientists and making the field more equitable and inclusive. With this in mind, we will take into consideration personal experiences as well as efforts in education, outreach or other service activities related to Earth system science or other sciences, which may be described in a separate section of the research statement.  Applicants must apply online to https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/18341. We would like to broaden participation in earth system scientific research and therefore encourage applications from groups historically under-represented in science.  These positions are subject to the University?s background check policy.

Princeton University is an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
