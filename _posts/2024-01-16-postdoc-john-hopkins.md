The Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, invites applications for a postdoctoral research associate or assistant research scientist. The successful candidate will join a research group interested in understanding fundamental ocean dynamics, and focus on processes in the subinertial frequency range (several days) in the subpolar North Atlantic region, in particular the Greenland-Scotland Ridge. 

The research team aims to advance knowledge of the role of small-scale processes on the large-scale, low frequency general circulation of the ocean, and in high Reynolds number rotating stratified fluids in general. The group has several high-resolution ocean simulations available, as well as (open-source) tools that aid in the analysis of such large data products.

Please feel free to circulate this announcement, get in touch with any questions, or apply directly here: https://apply.interfolio.com/137390.  The deadline for applications is Jan 19th 2024.
