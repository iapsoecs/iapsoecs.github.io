Postdoctoral Fellow in Arctic oceanâ€“ice dynamics. Closing date 30 April, 2021. 
This two-years postdoctoral position will examine interactions between Arctic Atlantic Water and the North Greenlandic Ice Sheet. A focus is the Ryder Glacier, which has Greenland's third largest floating ice tongue. The position is part of an international project, including Stockholm University and US partners, that investigates the dynamics of the North Greenland's marine cryosphere and its role for climate and sea level rise.

PhD Position Arctic Ocean dynamics. Closing date 23 April, 2012.
This four-years Ph. D. project uses remote sensing and modelling to study the circulation of Atlantic Water in the Arctic Ocean. An aim is to develop an improved representation of the Arctic Atlantic Water circulation during the satellite-altimetry era.The project is a collaboration with University of Oslo, where another Ph. D. student will be employed to examine related questions. For more information and how to apply see:
