We have an exciting job opportunity for a (paleo) ocean modeller at NORCE
and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen (Norway).
This is a permanent researcher position. Please check the advertisement for

About the position:

We are looking for a researcher that brings oceanographic expertise to the
application and analysis of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) in
close collaboration with a wide range of earth system modellers at NORCE
and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research (BCCR) and the national NorESM
consortium. The successful candidate is expected to contribute with
modelling expertise to a vibrant national paleoclimatic community as well
as develop a relevant research agenda.
We offer an exciting job opportunity in the field of global ocean and earth
system modelling. The position is full time and permanent, and initially
funded for 2 years, primarily through the Research Council of Norway
project ABRUPT Arctic Climate Change.  By combining reconstructions of
Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events occurring in the 30-40 ka time interval with
multi-model simulations, ABRUPT will chart the distribution of sea ice and
ocean states in the Nordic Seas during past abrupt changes to further our
understanding of these enigmatic large scale climate shifts. This includes
exploring how they might be relevant for future Arctic change.
Smaller involvement in other ongoing projects, with similar competence
required, must be expected. The successful candidate is expected to attract
own funding through externally funded projects to support his/her position
as well as bringing in new junior positions such as PhD students or
postdocs. NORCE provides technical support to train its employees to
develop and write competitive research proposals.

Application only possible through Jobbnorge system (see link above).
