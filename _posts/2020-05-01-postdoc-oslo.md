Job description

Postion as PhD Research Fellow in Fluid Mechanics is available at Section for Mechanics, Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo (UiO).

The fellowship will be for a period of 3 years. Starting date no later than 01.11.2020.

The main goal is development of theory and model computations of the phenomenon of large underwater/internal waves in coastal water conditions, including where and how the waves are formed, how they break and produce vertical mixing.

The research involves three tasks. 1) Develop idealized models for underwater/internal waves, and conditions for their existence, generation and propagation. 2) Develop models that include breaking effects, flow separation effects and vertical transport. 3) Apply advanced ocean model(s), available at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, to map suitable locations and conditions for internal wave formation along the Norwegian coast, and possibly correlate co-existence of internal waves and coral reef location.

The successful candidate will be part of a lively research environment within EcoPulse 2020-2023, a research project funded by the Research Council of Norway, where scientists from UiO, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute in Oslo, and the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen collaborate. The overall project theme is, how breaking underwater/internal waves enhance the marine biological production at coral reefs such as outside Vesteraalen, and otherwise along the coast. Models and satellite observations are combined with marine-biological measurements on The Lofoten-Vesteraalen Cabeled Ocean Observatory (LoVe). He/she will be jointly supervised by Prof. John Grue (UiO) and Dr. Johannes Rohrs (Met.).
