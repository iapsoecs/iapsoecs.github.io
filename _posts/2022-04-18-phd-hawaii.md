The Stuecker Climate Dynamics Lab at the University of Hawaii at Manoa
is looking for a Graduate Research Assistant (PhD position) to work on
the coupled dynamics of future climate change in the tropical Pacific
with focus on the interplay between the atmospheric circulation,
clouds, and the upper ocean.

Starting date: Either spring 2023 or fall 2023 semester start is
possible depending on preference.

Requirements: Applicants must have a BS or MS degree in oceanography,
atmospheric/environmental science, physics, or closely related fields.

academic performance records are required. Candidates should have
interest in learning to conduct and analyze climate model experiments
with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), including making changes
to model source code. The successful applicant must complete the UHM
Graduate Division application process and be accepted into the UHM
Physical Oceanography graduate program. Please contact Malte Stuecker
(stuecker <at> hawaii <dot> edu) if interested in the position.
