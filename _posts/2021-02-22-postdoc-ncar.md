We seek two postdoctoral researchers to conduct research on improving climate models. This work is part of a new exciting international collaboration, MÂ²LInES:
Multiscale Machine Learning In coupled Earth System Modeling, with climate and data scientists from New York University, Princeton, GFDL, Columbia, LDEO,
NCAR, MIT, CNRS-IGE, and CNRS-IPSL. 

The research at NCAR will focus on two distinct areas: 1) Development of machine-learned sea-ice parameterizations using high resolution observational
information and 2) Learning model error from DA increments and its representation in coupled climate models".
