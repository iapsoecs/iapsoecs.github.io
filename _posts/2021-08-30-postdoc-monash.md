The 3-year positions will be part of one of Australia’s newest Antarctic research groups: the Australian Research Council’s Special Research Initiative Securing Antarctica’s Environmental Future (SAEF). SAEF aims to secure Antarctica’s environmental future and understand the contributions it will make to global environmental change by delivering enhanced Antarctic research capabilities, and strengthening Antarctic science, policy and governance.

 

SAEF is a consortium of world-leading Antarctic researchers, and integration into SAEF will offer the postdocs a collaborative research environment and excellent mentoring opportunities. Over the course of the positions, postdocs will be encouraged to develop and apply for more senior research posts, including ARC Discovery Early Career Research Fellowships.


Earth's systems impact everyone, irrespective of ethnicity, gender, age, religion, neurodiversity, identity and experience. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace culture, and value the many benefits offered by a diverse group of researchers. We strongly encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds to apply.

 

These roles are full-time positions; however, part-time and flexible working arrangements may be negotiated.

 

Links to the position descriptions and application instructions are above. Applications close Thursday 9 September 2021 at 23:55 AEST. 

 

We are particularly excited about this opportunity for two new people to join our team, and welcome enquiries by email.
