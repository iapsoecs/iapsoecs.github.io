(to apply click here: https://careers-whoi.icims.com/jobs/1379/job=Job+Board&iisn=Earth+Science+Women's+Network)

Job Summary

The Physical Oceanography Department at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (http://www.whoi.edu/main/PO) invites applications for a tenure track position on our scientific staff. We seek applicants with expertise in a broad area of climate dynamics that would complement the existing strengths in the PO department regardless of approach (observational, modeling, theory, laboratory). Possible areas include, but are not limited to, atmospheric dynamics, coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics, hydroclimatology, and the roles of land and the cryosphere in climate. Individuals with expertise in interdisciplinary and/or societally relevant research in the fields of climate dynamics, climate extremes, climate impacts, and/or climate risk assessment are encouraged to apply. We expect to hire at the Assistant Scientist level, but exceptional candidates at more senior levels may be considered.



The successful candidate will join a collaborative group of scientists who address a wide range of fundamental problems in ocean and climate physics, including interdisciplinary research questions, using observations, theory, numerical modeling, and laboratory experimentation. A world-class technical staff supports the use of a broad mix of traditional and innovative instruments and observational techniques to make measurements on all scales from microstructure up to global, and in all ocean domains including open-ocean and coastal regions. They also have the option of advising graduate students and teaching courses through the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science and Engineering.



D<https://careers.whoi.edu/opportunities/diversity-inclusion/>iversity, equity, and inclusion<https://careers.whoi.edu/opportunities/diversity-inclusion/> are integral to WHOI's academic excellence and leadership in the global scientific community. WHOI stands committed to a sustained Institution-wide effort to advance inclusion and belonging throughout all levels of the Institution.

The Institution is located on Cape Cod in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, a world-renowned center of excellence in marine, biomedical, and environmental science, with proximity to the research hubs of Boston, MA and Providence, RI. Its mission aims to advance our understanding of the ocean and its interaction with the Earth system, and to communicate this understanding for the benefit of society. WHOI is the largest private, non-profit oceanographic institution in the world, with staff, postdocs and graduate students numbering approximately 1,000. Together with an additional ~500 affiliates associated with the scientific endeavors of the Institution, WHOI is home to a vibrant international community and has a strong support system for foreign nationals.

WHOI offers a comprehensive benefit package that includes medical and dental plans, a generous employer contribution retirement plan, disability and life insurance, a child care subsidy program, vacation time, ten paid holidays, flexible scheduling and work arrangements, and family illness days. WHOI also provides dual career services for assisting spouses or partners. We have a dedicated team who will work with applicants to identify and explore available options within WHOI, the broader community, including the research hubs of Boston and Providence.

Essential Functions

As one of the largest and thematically diverse physical oceanography departments in the world, the PO scientific staff conducts fundamental research and education in ocean and climate physics, as well as interdisciplinary research. The successful candidate will conduct research with a climate-related focus. This includes applied or solutions-driven research programs targeting pressing societal issues related specifically or broadly to the ocean. Opportunities for interdisciplinary research exist and collaborations are encouraged with colleagues in the other science departments, centers, and labs<http://www.whoi.edu/main/departments-centers-labs>, as well as with researchers in the broader Woods Hole scientific community, including other institutions focused on marine and climate research.



Scientific staff members are expected to develop independent, externally funded, and internationally recognized research programs. WHOI's Scientific Staff are expected to provide for their salaries from grants and contracts. The Institution provides internal funding opportunities for developing innovative research projects and salary support when no other funding is available. Candidates hired at the pre-tenure level will receive an initial appointment for four years. Success of WHOI's scientific staff is underpinned by an extensive mentoring network.
