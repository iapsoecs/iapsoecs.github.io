The Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science (EOAS) at the
Florida State University (FSU) invites applications for a tenure-track
Assistant Professor position in the area of Large-Scale Physical
Oceanography. The ideal candidate should have a solid background in
addressing fundamental research questions about the functioning of the
ocean from regional to global scales. Applications from those skilled in
observational analyses, measurements, modeling, theory and/or
interdisciplinary investigations will be particularly welcomed.

Appointees are expected to develop and maintain a vigorous externally
funded research program in their specialty area of interest and to teach
courses and contribute to both the undergraduate and graduate degree
programs in the department. Candidates must hold a Doctoral degree or the
highest degree appropriate in Geosciences or a related field.

EOAS is housed in a recent building (2020) with state-of-the-art facilities
and laboratories, has 39 academic faculty members and approximately 135
graduate students, and offers undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in
Geology, Meteorology, Oceanography, and Environmental Sciences. FSU also
hosts a local High Performance Computing Center. Aside from the faculty
within EOAS, the successful candidate can expect collaborations with the
Center for Ocean-Atmosphere Prediction Studies, the Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Institute, the Marine Lab, and the departments of Mathematics and
Scientific Computing. For additional information on EOAS and FSU’s
resources, please check (https://www.eoas.fsu.edu/) and
