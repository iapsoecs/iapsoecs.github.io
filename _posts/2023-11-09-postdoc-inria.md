We have a number of post-doctoral and doctoral positions on ocean modeling to fill in our Odyssey team (https://team.inria.fr/odyssey/) at Inria (Rennes, France). Would you be so kind as to pass on this information to anyone who might be interested?
More specifically, there are:

 - A postdoc (2 years) on the dynamics and modeling of internal tides (Noé Lahaye);
 - several postdocs (3 years) and/or thesis on stochastic modeling of ocean dynamics (Etienne Mémin).

More details are given on the team's website (https://team.inria.fr/odyssey/job-offers/). Please do not hesitate to contact us (etienne.memin@inria.fr or noe.lahaye@inria.fr).
