The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE,http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/), Jacobs School of Engineering and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO,https://scripps.ucsd.edu) at the University of California, San Diego invite applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professorship in the area of air-sea interaction modeling. SIO is a world leader in ocean/atmospheric sciences and MAE has a highly regarded program in fluid and thermal engineering sciences. We seek candidates who are pursuing innovative fluid mechanics research to solve problems involving small-scale physical processes at the air-sea interface through numerical modeling. These processes could include, but are not necessarily limited to wave breaking, Langmuir circulations, sea spray, and turbulence. The departments are interested in candidates who have demonstrated commitment to excellence by providing leadership in teaching, research, and service toward building an equitable and diverse scholarly environment. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to participate in and to expand ongoing research and educational collaborations between SIO and Jacobs School of Engineering (JSOE) faculty. The candidate is expected to demonstrate outstanding scholarship and professional activity in their research area, develop an excellent, funded research program, teach both undergraduate and graduate students, and engage in service activities in both departments.

Applicants are required to have a PhD at the time of appointment in Engineering, Geosciences, Physics, Applied Mathematics, or a related discipline. Preferred candidates will have demonstrated accomplishments in areas contributing to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and have a desire to participate in the diversity initiatives at SIO and the Jacobs School of Engineering, as well as have a competitive record of publication and service, and evidence of ability or strong potential to secure extramural funding and conduct an active research program. Salary will be consistent with the applicantâ€™s qualifications and experience and with University of California pay scales.
