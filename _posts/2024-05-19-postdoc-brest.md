These positions are offered as part of the EERIE project (Eddy rich Earth
System Models, http://www.eerie-project.eu). EERIE aims to understand and
simulate the role of ocean eddies in the present and future climate. Four
coupled ocean-ice-atmosphere models are developed in the project (United
Kingdom, Germany and Spain) with a fine grid in the ocean (4 to 10km). At
the Laboratory of Physical and Space Oceanography (LOPS), the two
postdoctoral fellows will use the numerical simulations run by the
modelling centres to understand and quantify the role of eddies in
processes that are key for future climate projections. This involves, on
the one hand, the evolution of oceanic stratification and the thermal and
haline content, and on the other hand, to understand and quantify the role
of oceanic eddies in the internal variability of the climate on interannual
to decadal time scales, and thus better quantify the uncertainties for
decadal prediction and climate projections. The initial duration of the
contracts is 18 months, with possible extensions.

The first postdoctoral fellow will study the dynamics of surface layers
(ocean mixed layer and stratification) in the coupled ocean-atmosphere
system in the presence of mesoscale ocean turbulence. The challenge is to
understand how this turbulence contributes to heat and salt budgets, and to
heat storage in the ocean in future climate scenarios. The second
post-doctoral fellow will study the interactions between mesoscale
turbulence and variability at the scale of ocean basins, as well as the
impact of this turbulence on interannual climate predictability. Variance
budgets will be used to quantify these interactions and their role in
internal climate variability.

The selected researchers will join the “Ocean and Climate” team at LOPS in
Brest (http://www.umr-lops.fr). LOPS is a joint laboratory between CNRS, Ifremer,
the University of Brest and the Institute of Research for Development. The
Ocean and Climate team is leader in high resolution modelling as well as
international ocean observation programs.

The candidates will hold a PhD in physical oceanography or atmospheric
dynamics, good knowledge of air-sea fluxes and ocean mesoscale eddies, and
experience with analyzing large datasets from observations and/or numerical
models. Programming skills and fluency with analysis software such as
python or equivalent are required. The international collaboration context
requires excellent written and spoken English, and the ability to work both
independently and as part of a team.

Starting date: May 2024, December 2024 at the latest.

Candidates must apply through CNRS:
