We are looking for a postdoc to join the research group of Associate Professor Justin Penn at the Advanced Institute for Marine Ecosystem Change (AIMEC) at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. The position will be broadly focused on modeling marine ecosystems and biogeochemistry in a changing climate — drawing on insights from both the past and modern ocean as a guide to the future. 
 
The successful candidate will contribute to the development of trait-based microbial and animal ecosystem models integrated within global simulations of ocean circulation and climate. These tools will be applied to a broad range of questions related to ocean biodiversity and extinction; marine productivity, the biological pump, food webs and fisheries; and nutrient and oxygen cycling, including oxygen minimum zones.
 
The position includes relocation and commuting allowances, full benefits, and the option to move into university housing. The initial contract is for one year with a flexible start date and with the possibility to extend for a total of three years.
 
Applications are due March 1st.
