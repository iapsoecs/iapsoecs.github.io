Job description

The climate of the polar regions is changing and will continue to change in the future. These changes directly affect the local communities, but indirectly the rest of the world as well by changing weather patterns, enhancing global warming and/or rising sea levels. Within the EU-funded PolarRES project, we try to improve our understanding of the polar climate and to reduce the uncertainties in climate projections, both by using high-resolution models.

In this project you will study various aspects of the complex polar atmosphere-ocean-ice system from an atmospheric perspective and derive and analyse projections of the future climate of both polar regions. Two state-of-the-art regional climate models will be used, HCLIM and RACMO. HCLIM, run at 2 km resolution, will be used to study the impact of rough topography and sea ice on the climate of Antarctica. RACMO will be used for future climate projections of the Arctic and Antarctic, with a possible focus on the changing cloud climatology and the impact on the hydrological cycle in the Arctic and the surface mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is foreseen that the outcomes of these analyses can be used to publish several papers.

As this position is part of PolarRES, an EU funded H2020 project, international collaboration with the PolarRES partners for model support, model analysis and dissemination is an integral part of the job.

We aim to start the job as soon as mutually possible.

Qualifications

We are looking for a driven, positive and collaborative colleague who is able to work independently as well as within a wider research team. In addition we would like you to have:
• a PhD in regional climate modelling or earth-system modelling with a focus on polar atmospheric processes;
• strong programming skills (Fortran, Python or similar);
• a thorough experience in running regional or global climate models;
• affinity with numerical model development;
• good reporting and presentation skills;
• an excellent level of written and spoken English; 
• the ability to critically assess your own results.

Offer
• a full-time position for 2.5 to 3 years;
• an inspiring, open-minded and open research group;
• a job with national and international collaboration;
• a full-time gross salary ranging from €2,846 to €4,490 in scale 10;
• benefits including 8% holiday bonus and 8.3% end-of-year bonus;
• a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave, and flexible employment conditions  external link based on the Collective Labour Agreement Dutch Universities (cao).
