The two positions are in

    - Coupled modelling, focussed on the effect of ocean model resolution in the coupled system. We are looking for someone with experience in ocean-sea ice and/or climate and an interest in understanding low-frequency variability of the climate system. More details here: https://jobs.anu.edu.au/cw/en/job/542141/postdoctoral-research-fellow_coupled-modelling 
    
    - Ocean Extremes, with an emphasis on marine heatwaves, ocean biogeochemistry and/or the impact of ocean extremes on extremes over land. This position is deliberately advertised broadly and could suit someone with expertise in either observations or in modelling. More details here: https://jobs.anu.edu.au/cw/en/job/542143/postdoctoral-research-fellow-ocean-extremes 


Both of these positions are funded by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, and are available for up to 3 years (depending on start date). The positions are available to international candidates.

Interested candidates can contact Nerilie Abram (nerilie.abram@anu.edu.au) or Andrew Hogg (Andy.Hogg@anu.edu.au) â€” or both! Applications must be received through the ANU system by October 8 as per the above links.
