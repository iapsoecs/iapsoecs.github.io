University of Tasmania is currently advertising a 3-year PhD position under the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership. The title of the project is: Understanding the ice-ocean interaction in Wilkes Land, Antarctica. In the past decade, the main mass loss in the East Antarctica was dominated by the Wilkes Land, which was attributable to the increases in ocean-induced basal melt. This project will focus on modelling the ice ocean interaction of the Wilkes Land system with a coupled ice sheet ocean model in an attempt to better understand the correlation between potential ocean thermal forcing and observed ice loss and retreat and find the evidence for ocean-induced melt being a driver for the ongoing mass loss.
