The Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) at the University of California San Diego invites applications for one or more full-time Researcher positions. We seek candidates in all areas relevant to the Oceans and Atmosphere Section, broadly including physical oceanography, atmospheric science, climate science, biogeochemistry, hydrological science, and related fields.

The Researcher series at SIO parallels the Professor series in terms of independent research and service, but it carries no teaching requirements. Researchers receive 25% of their annual salary support from institutional sources. Researchers are expected to establish an externally funded research program that provides the remainder of their salary support. Researchers at SIO often serve as undergraduate and graduate student advisors.

We seek motivated, broad-thinking scientists to develop vigorous research groups and provide intellectual leadership in their fields while complementing existing expertise in the Oceans and Atmosphere Section. We are interested in candidates who have demonstrated a commitment to excellence in research as well as service toward building an equitable and diverse scholarly environment. We anticipate hiring at the Assistant Researcher level, but exceptionally well-qualified candidates may be considered for the Associate Researcher or Full Researcher levels.

SIO is a world-renowned center of marine research with approximately 200 principal investigators leading research programs on all aspects of earth, ocean, biological and atmospheric sciences. SIO is dedicated to advancing belonging, accessibility, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (BAJEDI) for all who are or wish to be members of our community. We welcome candidates who have had non-traditional career paths or who have taken time off for family reasons, or who have achieved excellence in careers outside academia. Information about SIO’s ongoing diversity efforts may be found here: https://scripps.ucsd.edu/diversity. Successful candidates must demonstrate a commitment to promoting and contributing to BAJEDI in SIO’s educational, research, and work environments.
