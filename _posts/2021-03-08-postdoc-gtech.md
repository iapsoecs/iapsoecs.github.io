A postdoctoral position in physical oceanography is available at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. The postdoctoral researcher will work collaboratively on a number of projects focused on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.  Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will work closely with Dr. Susan Lozier, the international lead for the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP; www.o-snap.org<http://www.o-snap.org>), on the study of heat, freshwater and volume transports in the subpolar North Atlantic; deep water pathways throughout the Atlantic basin; the impact of subpolar dynamics on the variability of the meridional overturning circulation and the mechanisms governing that variability.

The initial term of the appointment will be 12 months, with the possibility of extension for another two years based on performance.

Job Responsibility:  The individual will be expected to conduct independent, high-quality research in physical oceanography; publish papers; and present work at national and international conferences.  The researcher will also work collaboratively with oceanographers at Georgia Tech and elsewhere on projects related to OSNAP.  Opportunities for cruise participation as part OSNAP will be available.

Qualifications: A PhD in physical oceanography or a related field is required by the time of appointment. A background in large-scale oceanography is preferable and experience with observational and model data sets is desirable.  Excellent organizational and collaborative skills are required and strong oral and written communication skills are expected.

Start date: On or about June 1, 2021.

Salary: Commensurate with the individual?s experience and education.
