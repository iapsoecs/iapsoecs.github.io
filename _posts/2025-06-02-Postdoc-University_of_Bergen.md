There is a vacancy for a postdoctoral research fellow position postdoctoral position within marine biogeochemical modelling at the Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research. 

The position is for a fixed term of 3 years.
The position is associated with three Horizon Europe projects; OceanICU, SEAClim, and TipESM, funded by the European Union under GA Nr. 101083922, GA Nr. 101180125, and GA Nr. 101137673.

For this position, we are looking for a candidate that will increase our understanding of multiyear-to-centennial changes in marine biogeochemistry related to climate change and the internal variability of the Earth System. The successful applicant will quantify the predictability of changes in marine biogeochemistry by analysing state-of-the art Climate Prediction Models. The candidate will further analyse adaptive emission scenarios to quantify safe mitigation pathways for selected tipping elements in the Earth System.
