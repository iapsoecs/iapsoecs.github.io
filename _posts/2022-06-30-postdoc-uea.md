We seek a highly motivated researcher with strong technical experience in computer modelling to support the development and use of a model of the global ocean carbon cycle for climate change research. The position is suitable for researchers from a wide range of fields with experience in computer modelling and interest in the carbon cycle and climate change. Enthusiastic and imaginative researchers in physics, computer sciences or mathematics interested to contribute to climate science are particularly encouraged to apply. This post plays a central role for a research team focused on understanding the interactions between climate change and the ocean carbon cycle, especially those mediated by marine ecosystems. Depending on interests, the position can be adapted to be more focused on the technical developments of the model or on the scientific interpretation of results. Funding for the post is secured until March 2025 in a first instance. Closing date Monday 4 July.
