## Scientifique de projet – Indicateurs océaniques (F/H) / Project scientist – Ocean indicators (W/M)

### Who are we?

Mercator Ocean International has been developing operational oceanography activities for nearly 25 years, as part of its public interest mission to preserve the ocean.

Many scientific and societal challenges must be met to ensure a sustainable ocean, whether they concern the environment, biodiversity, climate change, the blue economy or education. To meet these challenges, Mercator Ocean designs, develops, operates and maintains state-of-the-art digital systems capable of describing, analysing and forecasting the state of the ocean in 3D, continuously and in real time. The scientific information is then translated to be accessible to all, whether they are public or commercial services, political decision makers, industrialists, associations, NGOs, teachers or citizens. Mercator Ocean International thus combines scientific excellence and social commitment on a daily basis.

As a non-profit company under multinational governance (ES, FR, GB, IT, NO), we work in a climate of trust with our ten shareholder partners, all key players in the development of European oceanography.
