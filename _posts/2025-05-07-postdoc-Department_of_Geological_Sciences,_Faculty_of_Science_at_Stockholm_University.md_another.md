We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher for our interdisciplinary project, Tracing How Atlantic Water Impacts North Greenland (THAWING), funded by the Swedish Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (https://kaw.wallenberg.org/inflode-av-atlantvatten-i-arktis-hotar-gronlands-isar).
This position is one of several positions within THAWING and is ideal for a scientist interested in advanced observational data analysis, enhanced by machine learning techniques. The research focuses on marine-terminating glaciers in North Greenland, leveraging unique datasets from three icebreaker expeditions. You will investigate ocean circulation in this region using CTD, ADCP and hydro-acoustic data, integrating machine learning to identify ocean stratification and tracking of water masses.

This two-year postdoctoral position, with a possible one-year extension, offers an exciting opportunity to contribute to critical climate research using cutting-edge geophysical tools and AI-driven analysis. The THAWING project aims to bridge key knowledge gaps regarding ocean-ice interactions in North Greenland and involves collaboration with an international team of scientists. By joining this project, you will engage with a multidisciplinary network and contribute to understanding how climate change affects one of the Arcticâ€™s remaining perennially sea-ice covered areas. There may be opportunities for additional fieldwork within the project.

Responsibilities: 

* Data Analysis: Explore the potential of midwater acoustic measurements to capture key data on water column structure, temperature, salinity, and currents. This will include machine learning techniques to enhance data interpretation using pattern recognition. Acoustic data are analyzed alongside other observational datasets (e.g., CTD data and discrete biogeochemical sampling) to investigate Atlantic Water circulation within the glacial fjords and the adjacent Lincoln Sea
* Collaborative Research: Integrate observational data with modeling efforts, contributing to improved understanding of subsurface melt of marine-terminating glaciers through interdisciplinary collaboration
* Fieldwork: Potential opportunities for additional fieldwork in marine-terminating glacier environments around Svalbard
* Dissemination: Publish results in leading scientific journals and present findings at international conferences.
