WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

The MACMOlab team (IEO/CSIC) offers TWO POSITIONS (PhD and BSc/MSc) to 
work in ocean modelling in the framework of the BELICH project. The 
activities will focus on modelling coastal processes at different time 
scales. These will imply implementing and running ocean models and 
processing and analysing model outputs.
The primary goal of these positions is to work on the Mar Menor lagoon 
to understand and predict the hydrodynamic variability in the area. 
The project also requires the interaction with experts from other 
areas (biology, marine chemistry, hydrologists) to better explain and 
model the physical-biological interactions in the lagoon at different 
timescales. Previous experience on ocean or atmosphere numerical 
modelling and/or on physical oceanography will be appreciated.
Female applicants are given preference in the case of equal 
qualifications and suitability, as the position belongs to a working 
group in which women are underrepresented.

ABOUT US

The Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO/CSIC) is a public research 
organization dedicated to research in marine science, especially in 
relation to scientific knowledge of the oceans, sustainability of 
fishing resources and the marine environment.
The goals of the Marine Climate and Modelling Lab (MACMOLab), located 
in Mallorca (https://macmolab.wordpress.com/ , www.ba.ieo.es[1]), are 
to improve our understanding of regional marine climate, and to 
contribute from the knowledge to the transformation that is required 
to face different societal challenges. The work in the lab is 
organized around three topics. (i) Climate Research to fill knowledge 
gaps and improve our view of regional climate at different time scales 
(ii) Low Cost and Open Source technology development to fill 
observational gaps in areas of interest, and (iii) Knowledge Transfer 
to different levels of the society to make a transformation.
