We are looking a Postdoctoral researcher to conduct research on the submesoscale eddy activity in the Southern Ocean.

This fixed-term position up to 3-years  is part of the large-scale H2020 SO-CHIC project regrouping 15 institutions across Europe (<a href="http://www.sochic-h2020.eu/" >). The overall objective of SO-CHIC is to understand and quantify variability of heat and carbon budgets in the Southern Ocean through an investigation of the key processes controlling exchanges between the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice using a combination of observational and modelling approaches.

The present position will focus on the role of submesoscale and mixed-layer dynamics in the exchange of heat and carbon between the atmosphere and the ocean interior. Design and analysis of high-resolution numerical simulations will be the main approach here but a strong interaction with the observational component of the SO-CHIC project is expected.

The successful applicant will be supervised by D. Ferreira in close collaboration with Prof. D. Marshall at the University of Oxford.

You will have:
•    A PhD in geophysical fluid dynamics, ocean/atmosphere dynamics or a related field
•    Experience with numerical modelling and HPC
•    Good writing and communication skills

Interviews will be held on 2 March 2020.
