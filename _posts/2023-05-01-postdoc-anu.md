We have two more positions being advertised at the Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University:

1. Backfill faculty position in climate sciences

This is a 2.5 year fixed term appointment to temporarily replace a faculty member on a fellowship. Applications welcomed from candidates with expertise across ocean, atmosphere and climate science. 
See: https://jobs.anu.edu.au/cw/en/job/550775/research-fellow
Applications close May 31
Contact: RSES Director, Dorrit Jacob

2. Postdoctoral Fellow in Ocean Temperature Extremes (3 year position)

The successful candidate will work as part of the National Environmental Science Program Oceans and Coasts program to understand ocean temperature extremes in current and future climates. The Postdoctoral Fellow will investigate the atmosphere and ocean dynamics and thermodynamics leading to the most extreme sea surface temperatures and assess their representation in current climate models. The work will involve running realistic and/or idealised coupled model simulations and will likely involve collaborative model development to improve the representation of air-sea fluxes. The position is based in the Climate and Fluid Physics Group at the Australian National University.
