The Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde (IOW) takes part in a collaborative research mission on the effects of ocean alkalinity enhancement.
This postdoc position is about using an existing ecosystem model to understand the possible implications of alkalinity enhancement, which is being discussed as a possible option to increase the ocean’s capacity to take up atmospheric CO2.

This full-time position is limited to 35 months and starts on March 1st, 2022. Please apply until January 9th!

Our interdisciplinary institute is located directly at the beach in Warnemünde, a popular seaside resort which belongs to the city of Rostock (200.000 inhabitants). Rostock with its university is a lively city and offers a lot of free-time possibilities (when COVID is over) and still quite affordable housing. A direct train takes 2 hours to Berlin and 2.5 hours to its new airport.
