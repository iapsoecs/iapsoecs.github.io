Position Title: Postdoctoral Research Associate

Position Description: The Geosciences Department at Princeton University is seeking a
Postdoctoral Research Associate or more senior researcher in the area of ocean circulation and
biogeochemistry modeling to work with Professor Laure Resplandy. The postdoc will work as part of
a new multi-institution project that seeks to improve our understanding of the oceanic budgets of
carbon, heat, and oxygen by combining observations, biogeochemical models, and machine
learning.

The ideal candidate will have a background in ocean modeling, but candidates with the necessary
background in ocean biogeochemistry and/or geophysical fluid dynamics will be given full
consideration. A Ph.D. in Geosciences or a related field is required. Postdoctoral appointments are
initially for one year with renewal for subsequent years based on satisfactory performance and
continued funding. A competitive salary is offered commensurate with experience and
qualifications.
