Physical Oceanographer - WaveWatch III Modeller

We are currently seeking a talented WaveWatch III Modeller to join our Research and Development team. MetOcean Solutions is a science-based consultancy and forecast supplier providing specialist numerical modelling and analytical solutions in meteorology and oceanography. As a division of New Zealand's MetService, MetOcean has the mission to provide accurate and timely national operational ocean forecasts. With offices across New Zealand (Auckland, New Plymouth, Raglan, and Wellington) and in Sydney, Australia (MetraWeather) our international team works on projects and data analysis world-wide. We passionately believe in rigorous scientific method and in applying the latest information technology to data services. With scientific integrity and positive public perception in its core values, MetOcean occupies several niche marine consultancy and service roles and has a rapidly growing forecast and hindcast sector.
We are seeking a self-starter to research and deliver global and regional wave modelling innovations that align with planned benefits and impact for New Zealand. You will also develop and maintain our WaveWatch III model simulations and participate in the integration of the model improvements and developments into the operational forecast system.
Our employees enjoy an open-office, upbeat culture within a coastal town environment in the North Island of New Zealand. This position would be primarily based in Raglan with some opportunity to work from other offices in the future. Raglan is a small beach side town on the West Coast, just a short drive west of Hamilton or a two-hour drive south of Auckland. It is known for its world-class surf, stunning scenery, beautiful beaches and inspiring arts.
Our company promotes a positive working environment to achieve our shared goals, supported by flexible hours to ensure a healthy work-life balance. We encourage our people to bring fresh ideas to the table, rise to any challenge, and remain passionate about our products and the company mission.
This is a fantastic opportunity to work in a growing environment with an interesting and challenging mix of applied research, science and technology. We love to hear from you, if you have a post-graduate qualification (minimum of M.Sc.) in a relevant physical science or related field and advanced skills in numerical wave modelling using WaveWatch III.
