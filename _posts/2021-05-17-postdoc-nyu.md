We are looking for a postdoc to join our team at NYU and work at the interface of climate science and machine learning. 
The postdoc will perform research as part of the new multi-institution international project, M²LInES https://m2lines.github.io, supported by Schmidt Futures which aims to further our understanding of climate processes and to reduce climate model biases at the air-sea/ice interface, using scientific machine learning.  

This specific position at NYU will focus on using output from high-resolution simulations and data-assimilation products together with machine learning models to deepen our understanding of ocean mesoscale momentum and energy transport, in particular at the air-sea interface and to develop new mesoscale parameterizations for use in existing global climate models. For examples of our work in this area, see http://tinyurl.com/ymun5tbm ;  http://tinyurl.com/4en75d2m ; https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10506419.1. 

The postdoc is expected to actively collaborate with the entire  M²LInES project team. The position, available immediately, is a full-time appointment initially for one year, with the possibility of renewal for up to five years, subject to satisfactory performance and available funding.
