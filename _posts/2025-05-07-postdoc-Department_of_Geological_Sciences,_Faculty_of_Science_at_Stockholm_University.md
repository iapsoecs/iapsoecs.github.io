## Project description

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to investigate the paleoceanography on the North Greenland margin during the Holocene, back to 14 kyrs. The goal will be to reconstruct water mass properties, including their temperature, meltwater and nutrient characteristics in relation to the evolving North Greenland ice margin, with a focus on inorganic geochemical proxies. This role offers an exciting opportunity to develop and apply proven and emerging techniques, such as 18O, Mg/Ca and/or clumped isotopes, to unravel ocean-climatic history and forcings in a remote and unexplored region of the Arctic experiencing pressing environmental change. You will work with marine sediment cores collected from past expeditions to North Greenland. You will be part of a team of PhD students and postdocs collaborating to resolve ocean-ice interactions on the North Greenland margin.

This postdoctoral position is for two years, with the possibility of a one-year extension. It is part of THAWING, a major project funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. The project investigates how changes in the properties and pathways of Atlantic Water reaching North Greenland influence both the near-term stability and long-term evolution of the North Greenland Ice Sheet, its marine cryosphere, and sea-ice ecosystems (https://kaw.wallenberg.org/inflode-av-atlantvatten-i-arktis-hotar-gronlands-isar). As such, the project involves collaboration with other postdoctoral scientists, PhD students, and faculty within the Department of Geological Sciences and other scientists in the Bolin Centre for Climate Research at Stockholm University. This initiative provides a unique opportunity for you to engage with a broad multi-disciplinary network and apply a variety of analysis methods to state of the art ocean and climate models to contribute to our understanding of the vulnerability of the Arctic ocean. 

## Qualification requirements

Postdoctoral positions are appointed primarily for purposes of research. Applicants are expected to hold a Swedish doctoral degree or an equivalent degree from another country.

## Assessment criteria

The degree must have been completed at latest before the employment decision is made, but no more than three years before the closing date. An older degree may be acceptable under special circumstances. Special reasons refer to sick leave, parental leave, elected positions in trade unions, service in the total defense, or other similar circumstances as well as clinical attachment or service/assignments relevant to the subject area.

We seek candidates with a strong background in proxy-based paleoceanography, with an interest in Artic marine systems. Proven experience of the analysis and interpretation of 18O, Mg/Ca and/or clumped isotopes data in the context of marine geology and paleoceanography is highly desirable. Likewise, it is meriting to have documented experience in foraminifera or ostracod geochemistry, and Arctic climate history.

The candidate should be fluent in English, and be able to work independently and in groups, as well as towards deadlines. The successful applicant will be expected to be based in Stockholm and potentially undertake research stays at partner institutions, e.g. in Norway, USA, and/or the UK. There may also be an opportunity to participate in a future ice breaker expedition to the Artic Ocean.

The selection will be based on how well the applicant is assumed to be able to complete the project tasks. Particular emphasis is placed on the applicant´s knowledge and skills within the subject of his/her proposed specialization, capability to express their work orally and in writing, creativity, ability to take initiatives, independence and ability to work with other researchers. The evaluation is based on previous education and experience, quality of previous published research, ambition expressed in the motivation letter, description of the proposed project direction and potentially interviews. In the appointment process, special attention will be given to research skills. We ask applicants to include with their application a brief (max 2 pages) research proposal outlining how they would meet the project goals using relevant micropaleontological techniques. This will also be important in the selection process. 

## About the employment

The position involves full-time employment for a minimum of two years and a maximum of three years, with the possibility of extension under special circumstances. Start date as per agreement but no sooner than 1st July 2025.
