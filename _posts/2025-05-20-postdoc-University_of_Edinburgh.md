I am advertising a two-year Postdoctoral Research Assistant (PDRA) to carry out research into generating Earth System Models that show sub-polar gyre collapse.  The research requires numerical modelling, analysis and publication of results in world class journals. The PDRA should also collaborate with others in Edinburgh and in the PROMOTE (Progressing Earth System Modelling for Tipping Point Early Warning Systems) project. This project brings together researchers from seven UK research institutions and is funded by ARIA (Advanced Research and Invention Agency). 

The PDRA will form part of the PROMOTE project in which UK scientists are developing and using the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) to examine the potential collapse of the North Atlantic sub-polar Gyre circulation. Within this large project the Edinburgh component has the aim of generating a handful of UKESM variants that are less realistic but more sensitive to freshwater fluxes from Greenland ice melt. This will use advanced numerical techniques to calibrate the ocean/sea-ice component of UKESM to agree with North Atlantic observations and produce variants that are differently sensitive to ocean freshwater flux off Greenland. 

The PDRA should contribute to potential follow up bids for funding in the broad area of tipping points or the novel use of inverse methods in ocean or earth system modelling.

This post is full-time (35 hours per week); however, we are open to considering part-time or flexible working patterns. We are also open to considering requests for limited hybrid working (on a non-contractual basis) that combines a mix of remote and regular on-campus working. However, as the job-holder should interact with other researchers they should be on-campus at least three days a week. 

The salary for this post is £40,247 to £48,149 per annum.
