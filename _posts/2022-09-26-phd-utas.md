We are seeking applicants for a funded PhD project at the University
of Tasmania: ‘Quantifying the current and future role of East
Australian Current eddies in ocean biogeochemistry and productivity’.

The project will involve analysis of diverse data sets from platforms
including ships (CTDs, surface underway, triaxus 2D sections),
satellites, BGC-Argo floats and model output. We seek applicants with:
1. An Hons/MSc degree in physics, mathematics, oceanography or a
related discipline (quantitative physical or biological science or
engineering)
2. Programming experience, preferably in Matlab, R or Python
3. Familiarity with ocean biogeochemistry and physical oceanography
4. Excellent written and oral communication skills, demonstrated by
the production of a thesis or published manuscript, seminars or an
interview

The project includes participation in a month-long voyage in the EAC
off Sydney in September 2023.
