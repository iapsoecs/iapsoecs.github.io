Two new term federal positions are now open at NOAA's Physical Sciences
Laboratory in Boulder, CO. These hires can be at either the ZP-3
(developmental) or ZP-4 (full performance) level. Duties (at the ZP-4
level) include:

Conduct and direct research, analyze data, interpret results and reports
findings of national significance to enhance real-time forecasts of
physical coastal variables, including mean and extreme water levels along
the US coastline. Develop original research ideas and use a variety of
approaches, methods, and procedures to plan and execute assignments.
Resolve issues/problems that significantly affect scientific programs.
Write research proposals and contribute findings in scientific reports
and/or papers for publication in peer reviewed scientific journals.
Lead and conduct the development of prediction systems providing actionable
forecasts for potential users, on sub-seasonal to annual time scales, and
for atmospheric and oceanic conditions impacting predictions of variations
in sea level. Using expertise in the physics and dynamics of the coastal
climate system, conduct and direct development of regional ocean modeling
and/or advanced statistical techniques that identify oceanic and other
climate sources of coastal predictability to improve sub-seasonal to annual
forecast guidance of coastal oceanic conditions.
Work with appropriate forecast agencies to develop plans to test and
transition new forecast products for operational uses. Publish and present
research at scientific conferences and working groups. Provide advice to
managers, stakeholders, members of the public and/or other individuals and
groups

Applications are taken 2/7/23-2/21/23. For more, see here:
