The Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University, in association with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS), seeks a postdoctoral or more senior researchers to conduct research on decadal to centennial scale sea level rise. The overall goal of the project is to contextualize projections of sea level rise from the latest generation of coupled global climate models developed at NOAA-GFDL against previous generation simulations. The research at Princeton University/GFDL will focus on potential areas that include the role of different model horizontal resolutions, differences among climate forcing scenarios, ocean heat uptake and exchange between the upper ocean and deep ocean, and global climate sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing. The research will require analysis and interpretation of model output, management of large datasets, and the development of mean-state and process-level model diagnostics of sea level rise.  The postdoc will be expected to collaborate with researchers at Princeton, GFDL, and CO-OPS.

In addition to a quantitative background, the selected candidates will ideally have one or more of the following attributes: a) a strong background in physical oceanography, sea level rise dynamics, ocean heat uptake, or a closely related field, b) demonstrated experience in conducting analysis of ocean-only and coupled climate model output, and c) experience in ocean model development or conducting model simulations.

Candidates must have a Ph.D. and preferably in Oceanography, or a closely related field. The initial appointment is for one year with the possibility of a second-year renewal subject to satisfactory performance and available funding.

Complete applications, including a cover letter, CV, publication list, research statement (no more than 2 pages incl. references), and 3 letters of recommendation should be submitted by June 30, 2021, 11:59 pm EST for full consideration.   Princeton is interested in candidates who, through their research, will contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community. Applicants should apply online https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/19943.
