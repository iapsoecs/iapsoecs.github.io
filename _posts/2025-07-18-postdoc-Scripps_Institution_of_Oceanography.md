The Climate, Atmospheric Science, and Physical Oceanography (CASPO) Division, at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego invites applications for a 2-year postdoctoral position on north Pacific oxygen dynamics. 

Specifically, the postdoc will use global and regional eddy resolving models and a range of autonomous observations to understand the role of mesoscale eddies, large scale circulation, and climate variability in driving oxygen variability and change in the northeast Pacific, and evaluate the role of low-oxygen conditions in the development of marine ecosystem extreme events in this region.  

## The ideal candidate will have: 

* A doctoral degree in oceanography, climate/earth sciences, or a related field;
* Scientific experience in mesoscale dynamics, ocean biogeochemical cycles, and/or their interactions, though closely related research experience will also be considered;
* Excellent quantitative and computing skills; experience with High Performance Computing, open source languages (e.g. Python/Julia) and tools (e.g. Xarray/Dask) and analyzing large geophysical datasets, including models and observations;
* Experience with analyzing and/or running regional or global Earth system models including ocean biogeochemistry, particularly at high resolution;
* Excellent communication skills, oral and written as demonstrated in peer-reviewed journals; Ability to conduct independent work and work collaboratively as part of a team.


The postdoc will join Dr. Yassir Eddebbar’s research group and collaborate closely with Co-PIs Dr. Colleen Petrik at SIO, Dr. Sam Siedlecki at the University of Connecticut, and Dr. Liz Drenkard at NOAA GFDL. This position will be located at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, at UC San Diego, with a start date of September 2025 though some flexibility on start date is possible. 


## To apply, please include: 

1. a complete CV with a list of publications
2. a brief 1-2 page statement of research interests
