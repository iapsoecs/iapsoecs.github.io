**Physical Oceanography Postdoctoral Position -- Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) at Princeton University**

The Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University, in association with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), seeks an energetic and enthusiastic postdoctoral researcher or more senior researcher to participate in process-oriented studies using theory, modeling, and observations to develop understanding of surface ocean extremes. This effort is part of a broad effort to enhance process-level understanding of ocean circulation, the global carbon cycle, and climate change.  Of particular interest is how surface temperature and salinity extremes develop on weather to climate timescales and how well current generation climate models simulate these processes.

The individual will join a vigorous interdisciplinary research group at Princeton University and work in close collaboration with Drs. John Krasting at NOAA/GFDL and Gustavo Marques at NCAR.  The researcher will be able to take advantage of a wide range of related research at Princeton University and NOAA/GFDL, as well as external collaborators at the member institutions participating in NOAA?s Model Diagnostics Task Force.  Available resources include state-of-the-science numerical models and access to high-performance computing systems at Princeton, NOAA, and NCAR.

Candidates must have received a Ph.D. in the earth sciences, applied math, or the physical, biological, or chemical sciences within three years of the start date of the appointment. Rigorous training in oceanic or atmospheric sciences is preferred along with very strong dynamical, modeling, and quantitative skills. Postdoctoral appointments are initially for one year with the renewal for subsequent years based on satisfactory performance and continued funding. A competitive salary is offered commensurate with experience and qualifications.

Complete applications, including a cover letter, CV, publication list a statement of research experience and interests, and names of at least 3 references should be submitted by January 31, 2022?, 11:59 pm EST for full consideration.   Princeton is interested in candidates who, through their research, will contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community. Applicants should apply online at https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/23821.  Review of applications will begin as soon as they are received, and will continue until the position is filled.  This position is subject to the University?s background check policy.

Princeton University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
