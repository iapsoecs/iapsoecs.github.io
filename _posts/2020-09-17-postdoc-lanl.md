The Los Alamos National Laboratory is seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher to work on scale-aware ocean eddy parameterizations within the U.S. Department of Energy's Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). This position is for 2 years (with the possibility of a 3rd-year extension) in the modeling group at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, located in beautiful Northern New Mexico, USA.

Please see the full postdoc job description for more information:

The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work closely with E3SM project scientists, and will have the opportunity to collaborate with
scientists engaged in the multi-institution Climate Process Team <https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/> on ocean eddy energetics <https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/> (ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io). The successful candidate will help to define specific science goals
that are compatible with these broader requirements.
