Project: Future ocean circulation changes using ultra-high resolution global warming simulations  
Term: Full Time, 3 year, with possibility for renewal
Start date: March 2021, or later
Requirements: PhD in physical oceanography, meteorology or related field and at least 2 years of postdoc experience.


Applicants are expected to have strong computational skills, excitement to work on a new research subject, a good publication record, curiosity and creativity, and an interest in working in an international and interdisciplinary research environment. 


The main goal of the research will be to develop a better understanding of future ocean circulation changes using a suite of century-long simulations recently conducted at the ICCP with the Community Earth system model with 10 km global ocean and 25 km resolution atmosphere resolution. The successful applicant will study the mechanisms of global-warming induced changes in ocean mesoscale variability, and large-scale ocean circulation. Of particular interest are projected changes in Arctic Ocean circulation and the California, Benguela and Humboldt current upwelling systems.

The IBS Center for Climate Physics (ICCP), (http://iccp.ibs.re.kr) directed by Dr. Axel Timmermann, is dedicated to advancing the understanding of natural climate variability, man-made climate change and their impacts on the hydrological cycle, regional processes, ice-sheets, and sea level. The ICCP is generously funded through the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) (http://ibs.re.kr).
