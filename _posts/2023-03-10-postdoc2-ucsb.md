---
A postdoctoral researcher is sought to collaborate on the mechanisms for
the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) response to climate change. This is
part of a larger collaborative project in the Stevenson group at UC Santa
Barbara, designed to reduce uncertainty in future projections of 21st
century ENSO behavior. The postdoc will have primary responsibility for the
design and implementation of model experiments with the Energy Exascale
Earth System Model (E3SM) to isolate the effects of changes in mean climate
on ENSO, with particular attention to tropical instability wave (TIW)
dynamics. Part of the project will also involve the development of a new
suite of metrics to evaluate the accuracy of TIW representation in coupled
climate models. The postdoc will also have the opportunity to provide
co-mentorship of PhD and masters students involved with other aspects of
the project, as well as contributing to ongoing E3SM ensemble development
efforts at UCSB.

This is a full-time position. Competitive salary and benefits commensurate
with experience. The initial appointment is for 2 years with the potential
for an additional year based on satisfactory performance and funding
availability.

The University is especially interested in candidates who can contribute to
the diversity and excellence of the academic community through research,
teaching, and service as appropriate to the position.
