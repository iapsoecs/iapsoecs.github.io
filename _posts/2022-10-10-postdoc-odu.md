The Old Dominion University (ODU) Research Foundation in Norfolk, Virginia is seeking applications for a Post-Doctoral Research Associate to join an NSF-funded project to explore submarine groundwater discharge along the West Florida Shelf. The successful candidate will be responsible for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of Ra isotopes for tracing submarine groundwater discharge and associated inputs of dissolved nitrogen and iron to shelf waters. The postdoc will be expected to present their research findings at national conferences and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals. In addition, up to two-weeks of local ship time will be made available to the successful candidate for supplementary studies in Chesapeake Bay and nearby shelf waters. The postdoc will work directly with Dr. Joseph Tamborski in the Department of Ocean & Earth Sciences at ODU (Coastal Hydrogeology Lab) and collaborate with project team members from Florida State University, University of Florida, Oregon State University, and the US Geological Survey. This position requires participation in two fifteen-day research cruises off the West Florida Shelf in February and June 2023. The successful candidate will have a Ph.D. in Oceanography, Geological Sciences, or a related field and experience in oceanographic field work and geochemistry. Publishing scientific findings in peer-reviewed journals is needed.
