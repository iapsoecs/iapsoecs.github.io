**PhD Student Opportunity in Climate-Fisheries Connections, UC Santa Barbara**



A PhD research opportunity is available at the University of
California, Santa Barbara to study the response of marine ecosystems and
biogeochemistry to external climate change, with emphasis on implications
for fisheries. There is significant potential for flexibility in defining
the scope of the PhD project, and potential projects may include using
climate model simulations to assess changes in bottom-up drivers of fishery
productivity, interactions between climate variability and fisheries, or
marine ecological cost/benefit tradeoffs in future climate scenarios.
Students will have the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art climate
and fisheries modeling techniques, as well as syntheses of marine
ecological and fishery data in collaboration with the Cheryl Harrison Lab
at the University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley, in addition to other members
of the vibrant UCSB marine ecological research community.



Prospective students with backgrounds in a quantitative science, and some
past experience with programming, are encouraged to apply.  We strongly
support increasing the diversity of marine research; as such, we
particularly encourage applicants from underrepresented populations, or
with other types of nontraditional experiences.



Applications may be received either through the Bren School of
Environmental Science & Management:

https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/phd.html



or the UCSB Interdepartmental Graduate Program in Marine Sciences:

https://www.igpms.ucsb.edu/grad



*The deadline is December 15 for both applications.*



Interested students are encouraged to contact Samantha Stevenson (
