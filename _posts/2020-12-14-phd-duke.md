My group at the Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University has an
open PhD position to start in Fall 2021. We are a climate dynamics group in
the Earth and Ocean Sciences Division using observations, theory, and
modeling to understand the ocean's role in a changing climate. The
prospective student will have the flexibility to develop a PhD project in a
broad range of topics, including but not limited to the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation, ocean interbasin interaction, hydrological cycle, and
paleoclimate. The application deadline is January 8th and more details can
be found at the EOS website:

Applications from underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged.
Please contact Dr. Shineng Hu (shineng.hu@duke.edu) for more information.
