The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) is a multidisciplinary center for climate and Earth system research located in Hamburg, Germany. It is one of the premier climate science research institutes in the world. Located in the heart of one of Europe’s most livable and vibrant cities, it provides a highly international and interdisciplinary environment to conduct scientific research as well as access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities. You can also have a virtual tour to our campus.


THE POSITION

We are now opening a 2-year position for


Postdoctoral | Research Scientist (W-0032 | all genders)


to study mechanisms of water mass transformation and transport between the Southern Ocean and the Tropical Pacific, and their role in ocean-atmosphere coupling. Primary research questions to address are:

Which are the major pathways for transport between the Subantarctic front and the Eastern Pacific Equatorial Cold Tongue?
How are water parcels transformed as they upwell in the Cold Tongue and along the South American Pacific coast?
How does atmospheric forcing shape cross-isopycnal transports in the Eastern South Pacific Ocean?



The successful candidate will be part of the Theoretical Ocean Dynamics research group, which is dedicated to understanding how small-scale ocean processes influence climate. The group exists within the newly-established Climate Dynamics Department at MPI-M. Work will be done under the supervision of Group Leader Dr. Noel G. Brizuela and in close collaboration with Director Prof. Dr. Sarah M. Kang.

Based on performance, the contract for this position can be extended for a third year.
