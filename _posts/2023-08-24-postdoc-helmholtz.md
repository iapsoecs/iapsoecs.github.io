The Institute of Coastal Systems at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon in
Geesthacht, near Hamburg, Germany, invites applications for a PhD position
starting as soon as possible, in the field of coastal ocean heat waves,
their large-scale drivers and their seasonal and sub-seasonal prediction
applying machine learning algorithms.

The position is part of the project Projekt NECO "Naturgefahren und
Reaktion des marinen Ökosystems - Kausalzusammenhang und
Vorhersagbarkeit", which is framed by the bilateral program between China
and Germany MARE:N "Ozeane unter Stress". The project aims to identify
climate drivers and processes responsible for coastal heat waves and their
impacts on plankton composition and algae blooms in shallow seas of
Northern Europe and China. The position is hosted by Climate Extremes and
Impacts group, led by Dr. Birgit Hünicke. The candidate will also work
under Dr. Eduardo Zorita's supervision at the Hereon Research Centre. The
resulting PhD thesis will be defended at the University of Hamburg and the
candidate will be part of the graduate school SICCS of that university.
