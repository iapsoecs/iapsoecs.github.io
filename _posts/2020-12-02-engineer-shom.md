Shom (French national institute of hydrography and oceanography) invites
applications for a  39 months position of a research engineer specialized
in modelling submersion risks (wave and sea level) in Toulouse (France).



*Mission:*
As part of its support for coastal public policies, and with the help of
the General Directorate for Risk Prevention and the Ministry of Ecological
Transition, Shom designs and develops, in collaboration with university
laboratories and Météo-France, the operational warning system for storm
surges (Vigilance Vague Submersion system). The third phase of the HOMONIM
project (2020-2024), jointly piloted by Shom and Météo-France, aims more
specifically to adapt the modeling capabilities to the sub-departmental
forecast on the metropolitan Atlantic coast.

To this end, a new modeling system, currently under development, will
integrate:

   - A hydrodynamic modeling core describing different sets of equations
   (Shallow-Water, Green-Naghdi) coded from the common library TOLOSA (TOols
   Library for unstructured Ocean models and Surge Applications) for
   unstructured meshes ;
   - Two new configurations based on TOLOSA: one replacing the current
   regional model on the metropolitan Atlantic facade, and the second, at
   higher resolution and covering the New Aquitaine, which will allow a finer
   representation of coastal processes via a coupling between TOLOSA and the
   Wavewatch III (c) sea state model (OASIS coupler).

Within the Oceanographic Research Department of Shom, your work will
consist in carrying out studies and modeling of surges and sea states. You
will participate in all or part of the following tasks:

   - Designing new operational configurations for forecasting storm surges
   on the regional (metropolitan Atlantic coast) and New Aquitaine areas;
   - Carrying out inventories, data collection and processing
   (observations, meteorological data, oceanographic data...) especially those
   resulting from the RiCoRé oceanographic campaign (winter 2020-2021);
   - Carrying out calibrations and validations of numerical solutions based
   on TOLOSA (free surface elevation and currents) and Wavewatch III (sea
   states) on regional and high-resolution areas;
   - Optimizing the performance of the numerical solutions for operational
   needs and supporting Météo-France for the handling and maintenance in
   operational condition of the models;
   - Writing technical and scientific documentation for Météo-France and,
   more broadly, for those involved in the prevention of submersion risks.

You will benefit from the support of experts in modeling, hydrodynamics,
bathymetry and measurement from the Shom of Brest and Toulouse as well as
the Shom's IT infrastructure for high-performance scientific computing
(i.e. Météo-France scientific computing center, Ifremer's Datarmor
computing center). You will interact with experts from external
organizations and present your work at national and international
conferences.

*Qualifications:*

You have a minimum level of studies of 5 years (Engineer, Master 2, or PhD)
in physical oceanography or related disciplines. You have experience in the
following fields:

   - Physical oceanography;
   - Numerical modeling in coastal hydrodynamics and/or sea states on HPC
   platform;
   - Analysis and processing of meteo-oceanic data;

Knowledge of coastal hazards, meteorology and physical instrumentation is a
plus.
*Required skills:*

   - Professional skills in computing tools and programming languages (e.g.
   Matlab, python, fortran...);
   - Professional skills in high-performance scientific computing
   environments (linux, shell, parallel computing);
   - Ability to work in a team in a multidisciplinary context (physical
   oceanography, statistics, meteorology);
   - Autonomy, rigor, organization, excellent interpersonal skills and
   initiative.
   - Proven ability to write technical and scientific reports in French,
   professional and technical skills in English allowing for international
   written and oral communications.
