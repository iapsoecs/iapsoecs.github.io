We seek a physical oceanographer to join the Laboratoire d’Océanographie Physique et Spatiale in Brest (France). The goal of the project is to investigate the feedbacks associated with storm-generated surface waves and the changing dynamics of an increasingly ice-free Arctic Ocean. The project will first use remotely-sensed data (SWOT, SAR, SSMI, CERSAT products) to determine characteristic signatures of storms in waves, upper ocean, and sea ice. Basin-scale modelling based on a novel coupling between the NEMO model (ocean/sea ice) and surface waves (WAVEWATCH III) will then be used to use those storm characteristics to understand their seasonal response. Future climate projection scenarios will be used to explore potential impacts of changes in storm frequency and intensity.
