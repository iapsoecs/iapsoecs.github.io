Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI) of National University of Singapore (NUS) has a vacancy in the area of storm surge and tide modelling  in the warming climate.

The upcoming Project funded by a Singapore Agency for 4 years includes regional (South-East Asia, SEA) dynamical downscaling of storm surges using CMIP6 GCMs atmospheric projections for 21st century. The particular emphasis will be on storm surges trend and extremes in Singapore coastal waters. The successful candidate will be responsible for:

-setting and running DELFT3D Flexible Mesh (DELFT3D-FM) model using past and projected atmospheric forces downscaled by an atmospheric team;

-use model experiments and data analysis to compute and understand  mechanisms of regional (SEA) and Singapore Strait storm surge variability and trend driven by larger scale atmosphere/ocean processes.

 

Candidate will be having Ph.D. in ocean/coastal sciences/engineering from a reputable University.

Depending on qualifications and experience, successful Candidate could be employed at Research Fellow or Senior Research Fellow level.

Successful candidate will be having the following knowledge, skills and experience:

    Understanding of mechanisms of storm surge generation and propagation at various scales, from global to local. 
    Understanding of mechanisms of ocean/coastal responses to the climate change.
    Capability to set and run regional numerical experiments using DELFT3D-FM model.
    Capability to apply modern data analysis methods developed for sea level research;
    Experience with XBeach and OpenDA methods and software is an advantage;
    Ability to work in multidisciplinary team of researchers, including ocean/coastal and atmosphere scientists;
    Track records in publications.  


Salary range: S$ 5,000 - S$ 8,000 monthly
