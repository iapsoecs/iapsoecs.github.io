The University of South Florida, College of Marine Science is seeking a Senior Researcher in Ocean Mapping. This is an exciting opportunity that may be of interest to postdocs, finishing PhD students, or other suitably qualified scientists/engineers who may be looking for a new challenge in the sphere of hydrography or sea-floor mapping more broadly.

The Center for the Ocean Mapping and Innovative Technologies (COMIT) is a cooperative agreement between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the University of South Florida (USF). Based in St Petersburg, the post would cover 3 years of competitive salary, with strong potential for extension after 2025.

We are seeking applicants to join us to conduct and carry forward their own research in any field of hydrography that meshes with the Center's objectives of making seafloor mapping more efficient, more comprehensive, and more useful to the public. We are especially interested in anyone who has experience integrating sensors or developing navigation or spatial decision-making algorithms on uncrewed/autonomous systems; has applied USVs/AUVs in ocean mapping in novel ways; or is applying cutting-edge techniques in hydrographic data collection, processing, or analysis.
