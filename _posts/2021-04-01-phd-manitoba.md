Antarctica's floating margins are changing rapidly, influencing global sea level and ocean circulation. Much of this change is driven by interactions with relatively warm ocean water. We seek a Ph.D. student interested in studying this ice-ocean interaction using remote sensing tools, including (but not limited to) airborne radar, optical imagery, and satellite laser altimetry. In particular, this project will investigate the evolution of channelized basal melt on the undersides of Antarctic ice shelves. In addition, considerable flexibility is available in this project to involve studies of related past and present ice-ocean interactions in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. The successful candidate will work under the guidance of Dr. Karen Alley and Dr. Dorthe Dahl-Jensen. Candidates should ideally hold a Master's degree in Physical Geography, Geology, Oceanography, Environmental Science, Engineering, or a related field, but outstanding candidates holding a Bachelor's as their highest degree in one of these fields will also be considered. The start date for this project is flexible.
