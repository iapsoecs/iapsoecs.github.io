**Postdoctoral position in Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave Coupling at LEGOS**

The LEGOS (Toulouse, France), in collaboration with the CNRM (Toulouse, France), has received a 3-year JPI-ANR project within the framework of the EUREC4A-O campaign in order to carry out process studies of Wave-Atmosphere-Ocean (WAO) interactions and their impacts on the cloud cover and on the ocean dynamics over the Caribbean Sea using WAO coupled models. The simulations will benefit from observations collected from during the EUREC4A/ATOMIC campaign. As described below, LEGOS seeks one postdoctoral scholar to work on this project.

The postdoctoral scholar will participate to the development of a Wave (WW3), Atmosphere (WRF), and Ocean (CROCO) coupled configuration at the submesoscale over the Caribbean region. Development activities will concentrate mainly on definition of new configurations of the coupled model, tests of different parameterizations of wave coupling (to disentangle the different effects). The main scientific goal will be to analyze the extent to which wave coupling can impact the atmosphere (clouds and low-level wind) and the ocean dynamics, and whether it can modulate the thermal and current feedbacks to the atmosphere. Strong collaborations are expected with the CNRM (Toulouse, France), the GdR CROCO, the EUREC4A/ATOMIC consortium, and with the University of California, Los Angeles. The position is available for two years, starting as soon as possible.

Applicants should have a PhD in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, effective oral and written communication skills, and an interest air-sea interactions and numerical modeling. Strong programming skills and running regional or global numerical models (wave, oceanic and possibly atmospheric) are also essential. Applicants should submit a brief statement of research interests and goals and a complete CV, including contact information for three references to Dr. Lionel Renault via email (lionel.renault at ird.fr). Consideration of applications will begin immediately.
