We currently have a 24-month position on Air-Sea Exchanges at Oceanic Fine Scales opened at the University of Brest (UBO)  in the Laboratory for Ocean Physics and Satellite remote sensing (LOPS, https://www.umr-lops.fr/en), located in the  European Institute for Marine Studies (IUEM, https://www-iuem.univ-brest.fr/the-institute/?lang=en) in Plouzan√©, France.

This postdoc position is part of the project EUREC4A-OA (http://eurec4a-oa.eu/), which aim at advancing our understanding of the ocean-atmosphere interactions at the meso- and submesoscale using an unprecedented set of in-situ observations and high resolution simulations of the Northwest Tropical Atlantic Ocean.

The successful candidate will work with available observations from the Eurec4a campaign and data from forced and atmosphere-coupled submesoscale-resolving regional simulations using the models ROMS/CROCO and WRF. The objectives will be to investigate the impact of fine-scale ocean structures on the uptake of heat and energy in the ocean, and assess the impact of ocean-atmosphere coupling on the dynamics of these structures.  The successful candidate will collaborate closely with partners of the EUREC4A-OA and ATOMIC (https://psl.noaa.gov/atomic/) projects, which involve numerous international institutions in the USA, Germany, Italy, Norway, and France. Regular meetings and workshops will therefore be held with the project partners.

Candidates should hold a PhD in physical oceanography or fluid mechanics, and have strong interests in ocean dynamics and numerical modeling. Computer skills should include mastering of Python. Candidates should have spent at least 18 months outside of France between 1 May 2018 and the start date of the contract.

Candidates should send CV, statement of research interests and the contacts of at least two references to gula@univ-brest.fr and xcarton@univ-brest.fr. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled.
