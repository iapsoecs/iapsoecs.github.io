The University of Gothenburg tackles society's challenges with diverse knowledge. 56 000 students and 6 600 employees make the university a large and inspiring place to work and study. Strong research and attractive study programmes attract researchers and students from around the world. With new knowledge and new perspectives, the University contributes to a better future.

The Department of Marine Science (https://www.gu.se/marina-vetenskaper) at the University of Gothenburg has with its broad scientific competence area and its unique infrastructure the most complete environment for marine science and marine education in Sweden. Only a few similar organisations exist in Europe. Through advanced research infrastructure and the clear connection to societies needs and challenges, the department contributes to new solutions for the global challenges surrounding the ocean.

The Department of Marine Science conducts science, education and innovation related to the sea and its resources. The operation is conducted in Gothenburg, at the research stations Kristineberg Center for Marine Science and Innovation and Tja?rno? Marine Laboratory, as well as on the research vessel Skagerak. The department has an interdisciplinary width that includes marine biology, marine chemistry, marine geology, marine conservation and oceanography, and the research area spans geographically from coast to world ocean. Our scientists and students often have prominent roles in international expeditions, from Antarctica, Arctic, and the great world seas, but also work in our newly built laboratories with advanced equipment and complex analyses methods. The department also has a broad education palette, including a bachelor?s program, three master?s programs and a Ph. D. education in the marine domain.

Subject area description

Physics-climate processes in the oceans is one of the primary sources of uncertainty in global climate understanding and its future prediction. These uncertainties are particularly prevalent in the subtropical gateways that link the global overturning circulation. One such region is the Cape Basin and Agulhas Current System, where the current scarcity of observations that encompass the above processes, and the uncertainty of the correct scales to measure them means we know remarkably little about the interaction of the processes occurring between the millimeter to 100s of kilometer scale and their links to the larger climate system and its change.
We seek a Post Doctor in Physical Oceanography to address knowledge gaps related to fine-scale ocean features/variability as a means to understand vertical mixing and ventilation pathways and water mass transformation in the upper ocean of the eddy rich ocean south of Africa. These processes may also be related to heat and carbon fluxes across the air-sea interface, and beyond the base of the mixed layer. The Post Doc will use a combination of existing field data (primarily from autonomous platforms), new observations, to be collected during upcoming expeditions, and existing and new model simulations. Auxiliary reanalysis data and satellite-based products, including recently attained SWOT satellite data, are available to be used.
The candidate will contribute primarily to two projects: the ERC Synergy project WHIRLS (The impact of ocean fine scale whirls on climate and ecosystems) and the NSF project QUICCHE (QUantifying Interocean fluxes in the Cape Cauldron Hotspot of Eddy kinetic energy). These projects have a focus area spanning the Agulhas Current System and Cape Basin south of Africa.
The Post Doc will assist in the preparation of observational strategies for field work commencing in 2025. This includes the use of high-resolution model output to prepare field work strategies. There is the opportunity to participate in the kickoff meeting of the ERC WHIRLS project in early June, helping to design and plan field experiments, participate on research voyages and field experiment execution. There will also be an expectation to learn how ocean autonomous platforms function and are piloted (e.g., Seaglider, Sailbuoy, and Wave Glider).
Candidates that have experience in bio-physical interactions or biogeochmical processes in oceanography are also encouraged to apply.

Duties

As a Post Doctoral Fellow at the Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg, the candidate will be expected to fulfill responsibilities that include:

  *   Produce peer-reviewed publications of sufficient quantity and quality on the research topic and present findings at appropriate scientific conferences.
  *   Participate in research cruises that may be of weeks to months in duration in order to collect observations and/or deploy equipment.
  *   Prepare research proposals for funding on the related science topics.
  *   Participate and contribute to the activities of the oceanography subject and colleagues at the Department of Marine Sciences.
  *   Skill sharing between candidate and research group, and vice versa.
  *   There may be possibilities for the candidate to supervise MSc and PhD students in the related field.
  *   Assisting in teaching activities at times in Oceanography or Marine Sciences.

Eligibility

The eligibility criteria for employing teaching staff are set out in Chapter 4 of the Higher Education Ordinance and in the Appointment Procedure for Teaching Posts at the University of Gothenburg.
To be eligible for appointment as a postdoc, the applicant is required to have a doctoral degree, a doctoral degree in art or a foreign degree that is deemed to be equivalent to a doctoral degree. This eligibility requirement must be met before the employment decision is made.
In the first instance, those who have completed their degree no more than three years prior to the end of the application period shall be considered. Those who have completed their degree more than three years prior to the end of the application period may also be considered in the first instance if special grounds exist. Special grounds relate to leave of absence due to illness, parental leave, commissions of trust within union organisations, service within the defence services or other similar circumstances, as well as clinical service or service/assignment relevant to the subject area.
To be eligible you also need a PhD in Oceanopraphy or closely related subject

Assessment criteria

We are looking for a highly motivated and independent person with education/knowledge of physical oceanography. The person should be interested in extending and enhancing current observational capabilities in the Polar Gliders research group at GU (polargliders.com). The candidate will work with a strongly supportive team based at the university. There will also be mobility and collaboration with other WHIRLS PIs in GEOMAR, ENS Paris and U. Cape Town.
The applicant is expected to have a willingness to work in a team, to communicate with peers, good abilities to handle data and an ambition to learn new skills, as well as a willingness to go to sea to participate in international research cruises.
Any of the following experience is considered advantageous: understanding upper ocean dynamics, ocean turbulence, air-sea interactions, bio-physical interactions, processing field measurements, handling large datasets and/or reanalysis/model datasets, strong analytical skills (e.g. experience using Matlab or Python), participated on research cruises and been involved in sea-going sampling techniques, and evidence of active communication and outreach.

Employment

Employment form: Fixed-term employment, 3 years.
Extent: 100%
