The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (DEES) of Columbia University (CU) seeks applicants for a tenure-track Assistant Professor position in physics of the ocean and/or atmosphere. The position is expected to begin July 1, 2026 and is contingent on final confirmation of funding. DEES faculty perform their research at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), which provides a rich and collaborative geoscience community on its own campus. We seek candidates with a focus on global problems and using computational methods (modeling, theory, data analysis, data assimilation, machine learning) for physical oceanography, atmospheric dynamics /physics, and/or coupled atmosphere/ocean dynamics. The successful applicant is expected to develop a high-impact research program that is focused on problems of global significance, that emphasizes interdisciplinary collaborations, and that complements existing faculty interests and strategic priorities in DEES, LDEO, and the Climate School.
