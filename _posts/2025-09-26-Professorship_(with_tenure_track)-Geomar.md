Kiel University and GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel aims to attract more
qualified women to professorships.
The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at Kiel University, and GEOMAR Helmholtz
Centre for Ocean Research Kiel invite applications for a
W 2-Professorship (with tenure track to W 2) in Physical Oceanography
with temporary civil service status for an initial period of six years to start at the earliest possible date.

The W 2-professorship (with tenure track to W 2) is based at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for
Ocean Research Kiel (www.geomar.de) in the research unit “Physical Oceanography” which is part of the research division “Ocean Circulation and Climate Dynamics.”
The future holder of the position is expected to represent the field of Physical Oceanography in both research and teaching. The professorship includes teaching duties in English and, if
applicable, German (in accordance with the current teaching regulations, LVVO) within the Kiel Bachelor’s and Master’s programs “Physics of the Earth System” and “Climate Physics.” A suitable teaching concept must be submitted with the application. The research interests of the applicant should lie in process-oriented observational physical oceanography and comparative model-data analysis, and should align with the research profile of GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel as well as that of the Physical Oceanography research unit. Possible research foci include: ocean and climate dynamics, wind-driven and thermohaline circulation, water mass transformation, mesoscale and submesoscale variability, internal waves, and atmosphere-ocean interaction. Interest in the application of various modern observational methods (research expeditions, autonomous systems such as moorings and gliders, and turbulence probes) as well as in modern data analysis, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and data science methods is highly desirable. Active engagement in research collaborations within the research division is expected. 

Interdisciplinary collaboration with other research groups
at Kiel University, for example within Kiel Marine Science (KMS), and at GEOMAR Helmholtz
Centre for Ocean Research Kiel is encouraged.
Applicants must hold a completed university degree and a PhD in Physical Oceanography or a related field of outstanding quality. Internationally peer-reviewed publications in the field of Physical Oceanography are expected. Experience in teaching and in securing third-party funded research projects is advantageous. International collaborations within the EU and beyond are welcome.
Reference is made to the recruitment requirements set out in § 61 in conjunction with § 62 of the Higher Education Act of the State of Schleswig-Holstein. Following a successful evaluation and provided the further requirements of § 62 of the Higher Education Act of the State of Schleswig-Holstein are met, the aim is to convert the professorship into a permanent W2 professorship. 
For this purpose, in accordance with the applicable regulations at Kiel University, a corresponding
evaluation procedure is usually carried out one year before the expiration of the fixed-term
professorship. Further information can be found on the website: www.berufungen.uni-kiel.de (in German). Kiel University and GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel are striving to increase the number of female scientists in research and teaching and therefore expressly encourages
qualified women to apply. Women will be given priority if their aptitude, qualifications and
professional performance are of equal value.
Kiel University and GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel are committed to the
employment of people with disabilities: Applications from severely disabled persons and their equals will be given preferential treatment if they have the appropriate qualifications.
We expressly welcome applications from people with a migration background. Application
photographs are not required and we expressly request that you refrain from submitting any.
Applications including the usual documents (curriculum vitae, list of publications, if applicable list of externally funded projects and list of courses taught, copies of academic degrees, a compelling research and teaching concept [max. 6 pages in total], and 2 references) should be submitted, indicating both private and institutional contact details (address, phone number, and email), by November 5, 2025 — preferably in a single PDF file via email to bewerbung@mnf.uni-kiel.de — to: Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Christian-Albrechts-
Universität zu Kiel, Olshausenstr. 40, 24098 Kiel, Germany
For further information on the vacant position and the research unit, please contact Prof. Dr.
Peter Brandt (pbrandt@geomar.de).
