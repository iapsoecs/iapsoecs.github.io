This is a two year appointment to work on the NERC and NSF-funded project 'Pliocene Lessons for the Indian Ocean Dipole (PLIOD)'. Closing date is April 9th 2024. Please circulate to any interested researchers.

Briefly, the PLIOD project is a collaboration between QMUL's School of Geography, University College London and University of Arizona (USA). The aim of the project is to use the marine sediment archive and climate models to investigate Indian Ocean dynamics during a globally warm climate state three million years ago-the mid-Pliocene warm period. Our proposed paleodata will be used to evaluate climate model dynamics, constrain mechanisms, and advance our understanding of the Indian Ocean mean state and variability.

The major task for this postdoc is to reconstruct sea surface and subsurface and deep ocean conditions from marine sediment cores from the Indian Ocean. This project uses material from the International Ocean Discovery Program and its previous iterations.

Reach out directly to Dr. Heather Ford (h.ford@qmul.ac.uk) if you would like to know more about the PLIOD project or have any questions.
