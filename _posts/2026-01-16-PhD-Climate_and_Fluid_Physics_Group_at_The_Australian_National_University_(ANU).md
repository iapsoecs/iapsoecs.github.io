## PhD Scholarships in Physical Climate, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences

We invite outstanding candidates to apply for five PhD scholarships within the Climate and Fluid Physics Group at The Australian National University (ANU). Our group is internationally recognised for leading research in ocean dynamics, Antarctic margin processes, climate variability, and geophysical fluid dynamics.

Students will benefit from direct access to the Southern Hemisphere’s largest supercomputing facility and a 400 m² laboratory purpose-built for studying climate processes. You will join a vibrant community of climate scientists at ANU and collaborate closely via national research initiatives, including the ARC Centre of Excellence for 21st Century Weather, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Our Future Oceans, and the Consortium for Ocean–Sea Ice Modelling in Australia.

Throughout your PhD, you will have opportunities to develop broad research and professional skills through industry internships, graduate training programs, and specialist workshops in writing, communication, and professional development.

### Available PhD Topics

We are currently seeking PhD students for the topics listed below. Detailed project descriptions will be developed by discussion between potential candidates and supervisors as part of the application process. Relevant potential supervisors are listed for each topic.

#### 1. Coupled Climate and Weather

Changes in weather systems are reshaping global food, energy, and water security. Understanding future weather behaviour—and its links to dynamical processes and climate variability—is essential to supporting climate resilience. Projects are available in: Global coupled climate modelling, Air–sea interactions, High-resolution and/or idealised atmospheric modelling for the Australian region, Climate-hydrology interactions, Climate modes of variability and their impacts, El Niño-Southern Oscillation dynamics and future projections, Future climate
Supervisors: Dr Nicola Maher, Dr Chiara Holgate, A/Prof Callum Shakespeare

#### 2. Antarctic Oceanography

The transport of heat onto the Antarctic continental shelf influences deep water formation, ice-shelf melt, and global sea-level rise. Projects are available in: Ice-cavity dynamics, Ice–ocean interactions, Antarctic coastal current systems.
Supervisors: Dr Adele Morrison, Dr Kial Stewart, A/Prof Callum Shakespeare

#### 3. Internal Wave and Submesoscale Dynamics

Finescale ocean processes, including internal waves and submesoscale turbulence, play a critical role in ocean mixing and the uptake of heat and carbon. Improving their representation is central to advancing global ocean and climate models. Projects are available in: Internal wave–eddy interactions, Ocean bottom boundary layer dynamics
Supervisors: A/Prof Callum Shakespeare, Dr Kial Stewart

#### 4. Seamless cross-scale ocean modelling: from the coast to the deep blue. 

As part of the recently funded Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Our Future Oceans we are investing in developing a new ocean modelling framework that bridges between traditional open ocean and coastal models. This new infrastructure will simulate ocean physics and biogeochemistry, smoothly transitioning from existing global modelling systems at 10 km resolution, to circum-Australia models at ~1 km, and finally down to metre-scale models at the coastline. PhD students are sought to contribute to various aspects of this cross-institutional project as part of a large team of scientists and software engineers. Projects in this space would suit students with an interest in model development and software engineering.
Supervisors: Dr Adele Morrison, A/Prof Callum Shakespeare

### Eligibility and Support

We encourage applications from students with a Master’s degree or equivalent. Successful candidates will receive: Full tuition fee waiver, Tax-free stipend of AUD $39,069 per year for the duration of the PhD (typically 3.5 years), plus possible top-ups for exceptional candidates
