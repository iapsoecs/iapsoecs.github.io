The Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at CU Boulder encourages applications for an Associate Scientist position within the Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL) of NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratories (ESRL) in Boulder, Colorado. PSL and CIRES are participating in the NOAA “Climate-Fisheries initiative” to enhance access, analysis, and visualization of ocean data and model output. The chosen candidate will assist in the development of a centralized hub for climate and oceanographic information and the creation of new data portals for use in marine resource applications. The position will entail working with federal and university employees to build PSL’s data archive by downloading and processing large Earth System Model data sets and developing software that will enable users worldwide to access, analyze, and display the data. In addition, the individual may also participate in research projects contributing to publications and presentations.
