The Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering (CLaSP) in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan (UM) in Ann Arbor invites applications for a tenure track faculty position with expertise in essential components of the stressed climate system. We are especially interested in candidates who can bridge and strengthen our existing research and teaching portfolio in climate science and engineering. Specific subdisciplines of interest include atmospheric dynamics, extreme events, land-atmosphere feedbacks, polar science (including polar oceanography, polar meteorology and glaciology), or climate intervention strategies. The  department welcomes expertise in either experimental/observational (satellite, airborne, or ground-based instrumentation) research, theoretical research and climate/weather modeling, or data-driven research (including machine learning). Although the position is open to all ranks, we especially seek candidates at the Assistant Professor level.

We look for candidates capable of developing an internationally recognized research program, successfully competing for external funding, mentoring doctoral students, participating in our educational mission and programs at both graduate and undergraduate levels, and positively contributing to the culture, diversity, and collaborative nature of the department, college, and university. We value applicants whose research and teaching interests are cross-disciplinary and have the potential to connect to real world climate solutions in order to further understand and lessen climate impacts.

Applications should include: (1) cover letter, (2) CV, (3) research statement, (4) teaching statement, (5) a statement describing activities, contributions, or plans related to supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion, (6) and a list of four references with contact details. A PhD in a subject related to climate sciences or other relevant disciplines in sciences or engineering is required by the time of the appointment. For full consideration, applications should be received by November 1, 2022.

Questions about the position or application process can be directed to the search committee chair Christiane Jablonowski (cjablono@umich.edu <mailto:cjablono@umich.edu>).

The UM CLaSP research portfolio spans climate, space, and planetary science with annual research expenditures of $27 million in 2021/2022. The department currently consists of 28 tenure or tenure-track faculty, about 150 graduate students, a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) undergraduate program, and a Minor program in Climate & Space. CLaSP offers an exciting research and teaching environment with wide scope and rich expertise within the department as well as diversified interdisciplinary opportunities within the university. The climate research themes in CLaSP cover radiation, climate change, weather and climate modeling, remote sensing, atmospheric dynamics, carbon cycle science, atmospheric chemistry and air pollution, atmosphere-biosphere feedbacks, aerosol-cloud-climate interactions, as well as cryosphere research.
