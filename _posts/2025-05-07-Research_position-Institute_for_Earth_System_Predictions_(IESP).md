## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

We are looking for one postdoctoral researcher that will perform research, development and assessment exploiting the CMCC global ocean reanalysis system (C-GLORS) that combines the general circulation model NEMO and sea-ice model SI^3/CICE, with in-house ocean and sea-ice data assimilation system (OceanVar) https://www.cmcc.it/it/models/c-glors-the-cmcc-global-ocean-physical-reanalysis-system.

The successful candidate will be asked to support the implementation and validation of advances already planned and contribute to design the next evolution both at model and data assimilation level with particular emphasis on ML-based solution for DA. The research will focus on a wide range of applications, spanning from operational short-term forecasts to long-term past reconstruction of ocean state.

In this context, there will be significant flexibility to work across several projects and regarding the scientific questions to be explored, allowing researchers to align their studies with the broad scope of the division, the diverse expertise of the team, and their own creative insights.



## ABOUT US

CMCC Foundation is a cross-cutting scientific research center on climate change and its interactions with the environment, society, the world of business, and policymakers. Our work aims to stimulate sustainable growth, protect the environment, and develop strategies for the adaptation and mitigation of climate change. CMCC's core objective is to conduct cutting-edge science, to train the next generation of scientists at both national and international levels, and to be a beacon for climate modelling.

CMCC pursues fundamental and applied science with utmost scientific integrity, prioritizing data-driven science and providing data, information, and research results that can support informed public debate and decision-making processes. To achieve climate research objectives at the highest international standards, we invest in training all our talents and strive to create a workplace where everyone can excel.

At CMCC you will find a strong, professional environment. Join an inclusive community that values diversity, where every voice is heard and respected. Help foster a culture of innovation and societal change, where individuals from all backgrounds can thrive and succeed.

Over the last decade, CMCC has experienced extraordinary growth. We are now embarking on a new chapter of our journey that will further boost CMCC’s global position in climate change research…Together!

## ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The candidate will contribute to addressing challenges in data assimilation and model development in the ocean or sea-ice sector such as: hybrid solution for the background error covariance matrix, parameter optimization, ML-assisted improvements (observation operators, un-biasing), sea-ice/ocean DA coupling and any other aspect that can improve the overall realism of the simulation. The candidate is expected to :
 

* Conduct assimilative simulations to validate improvements and analyze long-term trend
* Integrate new observational datasets and advanced data assimilation techniques in our C-GLORS system
* Contribute to the design and implementation of present and new ML-assisted operators
* Contribute to improve the ocean/sea-ice coupling at DA or model level.


The successful candidate will be also part of the team that is charge of managing and updating the
Copernicus Marine Service Global Ocean Ensemble Reanalysis product https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_ENS_001_031/description
that includes CMCC reanalysis as well as products from different institutions.

## REQUIREMENTS

* PhD in physical oceanography, data assimilation, physics, applied mathematics or related relevant fields, or at least three years of demonstrated experience in the same areas.
* Advanced computer literacy, programming skills, scientific computation (you will work with complex FORTRAN and PYTHON codes in a UNIX / LINUX environment)
* Confident at data analysis and data processing using tools (e.g. Python or MATLAB), experience of working in High Performance Computing environment
* Excellent written and oral communication skills
* Evidence of ability to work independently and in teams.
* Experience with data assimilation techniques for geophysical field and with AI techniques are desirable.


## DURATION, COMPENSATION & BENEFITS

* Please note that this opportunity will be issued both internally and externally.
* The position will be based in Bologna CMCC office.
* The appointment period will be initially of 24 months with flexible starting date in summer 2025, with a gross annual salary range of 29-50K Euros. Tenure can be granted from 2 to 4 years after being appointed as a junior researcher.
* Welfare package, for minimum 12 months contract.
* Flexible working time as per internal policies.
* Support during the immigration process, if needed.
