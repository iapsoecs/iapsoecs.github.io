The MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at Bremen University
is looking for a
Postdoctoral Research Scientist (f/m/d)
in the field of oceanography,
salary scale (German) 13 TV-L; full-time (39.2 hours); temporarily limited for 26 months,
but until 31.07.2027 at the latest (according to § 2 WissZeitVG)
 
starting at the  next possible date.


## Project description
The project LOUISVILLE RIDGE aims to study the development and composition of ferromanganese crusts and biological communities in association with hydrographic features on the Louisville Ridge seamount chain in the SW Pacific. Seamounts are common and prominent features in the deep ocean. Environmental parameters together with seafloor characteristics that vary with depth are believed to determine species composition on seamounts. The physical structure of seamounts together with their spatial separation enable the formation of localized hydrographic features which may contribute to faunal isolation at some seamounts and accumulation at others. In this project, an international team of geologists, biologists, geochemists, and physical oceanographers collaborate to investigate the key determinants of benthic species distribution on the Louisville Ridge in relation to the occurrence and composition of ferromanganese crusts and to localized hydrographic features.

## Your tasks
The scope of this PostDoc position is a combination of observations and modelling. We are looking for a researcher with a keen interest to apply their training and experience on interdisciplinary problems: Within the project, you will participate in the research expedition SO313 to Louisville Ridge, where you will work with the project team to obtain hydrographic data (profiles and time series of stratification and currents) from the seamount chain, in combination with geochemical, biological, and geological data. Post-cruise, you will set-up a regional hydrodynamic model based on the MITgcm for the working area of the expedition, using the observational data for validation. You will implement a module for the dispersal of larvae, and conduct sensitivity studies with the aim to determine the physical connectivity in the study region (to be compared with the genetic connectivity). For the interpretation of the results, you will closely collaborate with the partners of the project, in particular the biologists. You will present the results at scientific conferences and publish them in scientific journals.

The position is located in the Physical Oceanography group at MARUM, University of Bremen. We offer you the opportunity to work in cutting-edge marine science research in an interdisciplinary team in the vibrant city of Bremen in northern Germany.
