The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) is a multidisciplinary center for climate and Earth system research located in Hamburg, Germany. It is one of the premier climate science research institutes in the world. Located in the heart of one of Europe’s most livable and vibrant cities it provides a highly international and interdisciplinary environment for conducting scientific research as well as access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities.

The MPI-M is now opening a (3 + 1 year) position for a Postdoctoral Scientist (f/m/d; W095) in the H2020 project NextGEMS - Next Generation Earth Modelling Systems (GA 101003470; 2021 – 2025). NextGEMS will develop and apply a new generation of Storm-Resolving Earth System Models (SR-ESMs) to the study of anthropogenic climate change.

The objective of this position is to evaluate and improve the representation of internal mixing processes in the upper ocean with specific emphasis on processes, which act to modify the mixed layer structure in the tropical oceans (Atlantic). The researcher recruited for this position will:

·         Analyze the representation of mixing and ocean-atmosphere exchanges in storm-resolving simulations

·         Design and carry out stand-alone ocean and coupled ocean-atmosphere experiments testing aspects of model resolution and various mixing parameterisations

·         Implement novel concepts into the numerical framework of ICON

·         Support the ICON model and infrastructure (e.g., output logging) development

·         Contribute to project and sub-task coordination

·         Disseminate the results through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences or through social media, video-blogs, etc.

 

Requirements:

·         A PhD in Meteorology, Oceanography, Physics, or Mathematics

·         Very good knowledge in oceanic processes and their representation in ocean models

·         Excellent programming skills in FORTRAN and statistical post-processing and visualization software (e.g., PYTHON)

·         Experience in modeling geophysical fluid dynamics and analyzing climate model simulations with emphasis on ocean processes and atmosphere-ocean interaction

·         Ability to coordinate cross-institutional research work and reporting tasks

Selection criteria

The selection criteria will value the qualifications, the experience and the ability of the candidates to fulfill the responsibilities as outlined above. A selection panel will be established for this purpose. In light of the institute and the funded projects commitment to support the career development of young scientists, preference in the selection will be given to candidates within a few years of their PhD.

 

The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology seeks to increase the number of female scientist and encourages them to apply. Handicapped persons with comparable qualifications receive preferential status.

 

Employment conditions

·         The position is available from September 2021 for 36 months, an extension to 48 months is possible.

·         Payment will be in accordance with German public service positions (TVoeD E14), including extensive social security plans. The conditions of employment, including upgrades and duration, follow the rules of the Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Sciences and those of the German civil service.
