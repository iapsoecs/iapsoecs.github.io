The Operational Oceanography Department at Mercator Ocean in Toulouse (France) is offering a fixed-term contract to someone with the following profile:

 **Global Ocean Modelling Oceanographer (M/F)**

You will participate in the evolution of the brand new 1/36° global model configuration based on NEMO. You will implement a new numerical scheme for the advection of vertical layers. You will apply diagnostics to quantify the contributions of these developments and will particularly analyse the impact on the tidal solution and vertical mixing. You will ensure the distribution of data with the other partners of the EU H2020 IMMERSE project.

Send your cover letter and a detailed CV with the following reference 2021-09/OO/OMOF to recruitment@mercator-ocean.fr no later than 30th of October.

Mercator Ocean International is a pioneer in operational oceanography and has been
committed for nearly 25 years to its public interest mission to preserve the oceans.
Environment, biodiversity, climate change, blue economy, education: the scientific and
societal issues related to the oceans are numerous. To meet these challenges, our mission is to
describe, analyse and forecast the state of the global ocean in digital form, continuously,
reliably and in real time, and to make this information relevant and accessible to all: public
and commercial services, industry, political decision-makers, associations, NGOs, teachers
and citizens.

Mercator Ocean International thus combines scientific excellence and social commitment
on a daily basis. As a non-profit company with multinational governance (ES, FR, GB, IT, NO),
we benefit from the confidence of our nine shareholder partners, key players in the
development of oceanography in Europe.

For the past six years, Mercator Ocean International has been managing and implementing
the "Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service" for the European Union, which offers
free access to scientifically qualified operational information on the ocean to several
thousand subscribers worldwide. To this end, the company runs a unique network of around a
hundred partners in Europe, specialists in earth observation and ocean forecasting.

Based in Toulouse in the south-west of France, the company has about a hundred of
employees, all of whom are committed to the United Nations' sustainable development
goals.

We are looking for a 12-month fixed term contract, with a possible extension, to start as soon
as possible. As part of the "Innovation" team in the "Operational Oceanography" department and in
partnership with the IMMERSE ocean modelling research project, you will implement a new
numerical scheme for the advection of vertical layers. Based on your developments, you will
perform sensitivity experiments to evaluate the impact of the new features on the new global
1/36° configuration of NEMO.

In particular, you will analyse the impact on the tidal solution and vertical mixing. You will
apply diagnostics to quantify the contributions of these developments. You will ensure the
distribution of data with the other partners of the IMMERSE project. You will participate in the
drafting of IMMERSE project progress reports and in the dissemination of results.

Your Mission:
● You implement the advection scheme PPM in NEMO4.2.
● You perform simulations with the global 1/36° configuration with and without this new
scheme, as well as with and without the new time advance scheme (RK3)
● You produce standard diagnostics and propose new ones to analyse the impacts, in
particular for the tidal solution and for vertical mixing.
● You ensure the distribution of the analysed fields within the IMMERSE project.
● You produce reports on the developments carried out.
● You valorise the results obtained by participating in the drafting of project documents
and by presenting the results in workshops.

Skills to succeed:

● After five years of higher education or a PhD level in physical oceanography, in
ocean modelling; you are familiar with the use of ocean models.
● You have developed solid skills in oceanography, scientific computing, programming
languages (in particular Fortran, Python) and in the use of supercomputers.
● Rigorous, used to working in a team, curious and open-minded, you wish to bring your
contribution and ideas to ambitious projects and international collaborations to be
developed.
● Your innovative skills and results will contribute to teams optimizing performance of
methods and systems.
● You speak and write English fluently.

Send your letter stating your reasons for applying, including a detailed CV with the reference
2021-09/OO/OMOG to: recruitment@mercator-ocean.fr no later than 30th October 2021.
