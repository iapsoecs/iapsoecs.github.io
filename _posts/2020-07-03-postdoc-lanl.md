**Overview:** Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is a multidisciplinary research institution engaged in science and engineering on behalf of national security. This 2-3 year postdoc position is within the Climate, Ocean and Sea-Ice Modeling (COSIM) team, which develops and applies advanced ocean and ice models for the study of climate and climate change. The position is within the Fluid Dynamics and Solid Mechanics group (T-3) in LANL's Theoretical Division.


**Detailed Description:** The postdoc position will work on the development of regional sea level change estimates using the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM<http://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/accelerated-climate-modeling-energy>). The work will use existing glacial isostatic adjustment and sea level models to estimate historic and future regional sea level changes from past, ongoing, and future changes to glaciers and ice sheets, terrestrial water storage, and ocean steric and dynamic changes.  The goal of the project will be to characterize regional sea level hindcasts and projections using ocean and ice sheet model output from E3SM.  This position is part of a larger five-year project to enable modeling of regional sea level directly in E3SM. We expect that the successful candidate will help to define specific science goals that are compatible with these broader requirements.


**Keywords:** glacial isostatic adjustment, ocean modeling, climate, climate modeling, global climate models, high-latitude climate dynamics, climate model coupling, sea-level change, regional sea level


**Desired Skills:** The successful candidate will have knowledge of glacial isostatic adjustment modeling, sea level equation modeling, or climate modeling; expertise in computer programming in languages compatible with high-performance computing (e.g. Fortran90, C, C++); expertise in shell scripting and/or data-analysis languages (e.g. Python, Matlab, bash). They will have also demonstrated scientific excellence as evidenced by submission and publication of authored publications in refereed journals and the ability to create or improve numerical models. The ability to work in a highly collaborative team setting is also a requirement.


**Education:** A Ph.D. in geophysical-fluid modeling, oceanography, climate modeling, physics, geodesy, applied mathematics, civil engineering, or a closely related field.


**Equal Opportunity:** Los Alamos National Laboratory is an equal opportunity employer and supports a diverse and inclusive workforce.
