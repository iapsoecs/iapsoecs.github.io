Are you interested in studying how sea level changes? And motivated by understanding how the different factors combine to an increased future sea level along the Danish coasts? Then here is the chance to join our skilled team of climate researchers!

The Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) opens a permanent, full time position for a climate scientist to work with sea level research. The position links up with other experts on ice sheets, climate model projections, remote sensing, ocean dynamics and climate services, with the overall aim of improving future sea level projections with a special focus on Denmark. The position is in the Danish National Centre for Climate Research (NCKF) at DMI, where you will work in a department with a strong profile in both global and regional climate modelling, as well as remote sensing.
Main Working Tasks

As our new colleague you will work with analyses of the different contributions to sea level rise, with the long term goal of improving future projections and reducing uncertainties. The work will contribute to the Danish Climate Atlas (https://www.dmi.dk/klima-atlas/introduction-to-klimaatlas/), which provides the data foundation for climate adaptation in Denmark. You will work with analyses of past and future climate change, and how to combine the state-of-the-art knowledge to the best possible sea level projections. Your tasks will include leading and contributing to scientific papers, and participating in developing new grant applications with colleagues and external collaborators. There will be flexibility in deciding the weight between working with different aspects of sea level rise, depending on your background, expertise and interests.

**Expected Qualifications**

    A PhD degree in climate science, oceanography, meteorology, glaciology or related fields (e.g. physics or engineering)
    Research experience with sea level research; either climate or ice sheet modelling, oceanography and/or remote sensing
    Advanced programming skills (Linux/Unix and programming languages such as Python, Fortran, etc.)
    Good communication skills in oral and written English
    Willingness to learn Danish (if not already proficient) to eventually be able to support DMI’s role as national climate advisor to the Danish Government.

**About DMI and NCKF**

The NCKF has been established with the purpose to conduct critical climate research for the Kingdom of Denmark (Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands) and bring together climate knowledge, to form the basis for green transition and climate adaptation. The activities include assessments of observed and future climate change of the physical climate system, with focus on the Arctic, Greenland and on extreme weather and sea level around Denmark. Across the department, polar research builds on both global and regional modelling as well as observations from remote sensing, in-situ measurements and field work. NCKF develops the Danish Climate Atlas (Klimaatlas) which contains detailed data about expected future changes in the climate across Denmark.

The position is in the Danish National Centre for Climate Research (NCKF) at DMI, which employs more than 50 climate scientists, including PhD students, junior and senior scientists. The companion Weather Research department employs researchers working with meteorology, oceanography and hydrology. We have a strong international profile, which is also reflected in the many nationalities employed and in the use of both English and Danish as working languages.

**Employment**

Employment and salary will be according to the Danish Law and Agreements, at the scientist level, depending on previous experience. It will be possible to apply for an addition to the basic salary. Researchers who are recruited from abroad, and who are able to meet certain conditions, have the opportunity to work in Denmark for a period of 60 months under a special 26 % tax rate without deduction, instead of working under the regular income taxation.
The employment area is the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Facilities and associated institutions. Your workplace will be DMI, Lyngbyvej 100, 2100 Copenhagen Ø, Denmark. Physical presence is expected, but ad-hoc work from home can be arranged.

DMI offers a flexible working week of 37 hours including a paid lunch break, and six weeks of paid vacation annually.

For further details about the position, contact Head of unit, Rasmus Anker Pedersen (telephone: +45 20 46 79 38 or e-mail: rap@dmi.dk).

The DMI wants to contribute to equal opportunities for women and men, and encourage all qualified persons to apply regardless of age, gender or ethnic background.

**Virtual Open House**

You are invited to a Virtual Open House to get more acquainted with DMI and the National Centre for Climate Research. Here you will have the opportunity to meet some of your potential new colleagues and to learn about some of our interesting tasks and projects that you might become a part of. We hope to see you online on Monday 8th of May 15:30 – 16:30 CET. Meeting links will be circulated after registration to head of unit, Rasmus Anker Pedersen rap@dmi.dk

**Application**

Please send your application, including (1) a cover letter with motivation for the application, (2) a curriculum vitae (incl. publication list), (3) a list of research ideas (max. ½-1 page), (4) relevant exam papers and diplomas, possible other relevant appendices and contacts for relevant professional references, so we have it in our system by the 10th of May 2023.

To apply for the position, please use the below link "Apply for Position", and follow the instructions.

We expect to hold interviews between 16-17th and 24-25th of May 2023.

Starting date can be as soon as possible for the selected candidate.
