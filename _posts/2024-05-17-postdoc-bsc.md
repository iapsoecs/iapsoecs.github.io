We would like to inform you about a new job opportunity offered by Barcelona Supercomputing Center:

The Atmospheric Composition group from the ES-BSC is looking for a postdoctoral fellow to work on improving our understanding of the natural and anthropogenic contributions to the soluble iron deposition in the ocean. Part of the research will consist of further developing and constraining the atmospheric iron cycle in the EC-Earth Earth System model. Among other key novelties, the researcher will incorporate observationally constrained information on the mineralogy of dust sources by the NASA-EMIT mission and explore the role of vegetation and land-use changes on dust emission in present and future climates. The analyses and assessments will be complemented with the incorporation of state-of-the-art anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions beyond CMIP6 estimates.

The researcher will have the opportunity to follow multiple training activities, including those aimed at improving coding and data analysis, scientific and project writing abilities, or project management. All this will be implemented via the formal courses organized by the Education and Training team and Human Resources, and the participation in the regular seminars organized by the department. The proposed research will be managed through biweekly meetings with the supervisor to ensure full coherence between the research planned and the general objectives of the department. The researcher will work in a highly collaborative environment, with tight links with other researchers in the Atmospheric Composition group but also other members of the department, including ocean biogeochemistry modelers. In this context, the applicant will be encouraged to participate in discussions and meetings involving several funded projects related to the fellowÂ´s work, including the Spanish ministry grant entitled BIOTA (Ocean BIOgeochemistry response To refined Atmospheric iron inputs in present and future climate) led by the supervisor, and other core projects of the group focusing on dust and climate research, e.g., the AXA Chair on Sand and Dust Storms or the ERC Consolidator Grant entitled FRAGMENT (FRontiers in dust minerAloGical coMposition and its Effects upoN climaTe). Female candidates are especially encouraged to apply.

The vacancy will remain open until 31th of May 2024.
