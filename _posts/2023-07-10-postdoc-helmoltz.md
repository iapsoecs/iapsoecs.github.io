We are looking to hire a Postdoctoral Researcher in “Oceanography, Mechatronics, Electronics or Measurement Technology” (https://hereon.de/career/vacancies/024337/index.php.en).

The application period closes on 11 July 2023, and we are looking to hire as soon as possible. For more information, please contact Dr. Yoana G. Voynova (yoana.voynova@hereon.de) or Dr. Jochen Horstmann (jochen.horstmann@hereon.de).

Within the framework of a Helmholtz funding line to strengthen transfer and innovation, the marine research centers of the Helmholtz Association HEREON, AWI and GEOMAR are establishing an innovation platform for marine observation and sensor technology, in close cooperation with industry (in the field of marine observations), and with operators of ships and measurement platforms. The project will promote the participation of civil society in the collection of ocean data, with the long-term goal of establishing a visible innovation platform for the new blue economy.

In the department of Coastal Productivity, we investigate coastal and estuarine biogeochemical processes, including primary production, carbon and nutrient cycles, and ecosystem dynamics, through the use of autonomous measurement technologies like FerryBox. Within this project, we are looking for a postdoctoral researcher to develop a miniaturized autonomous measurement system for deployments on small vessels, as well as autonomous floating platforms.

The position is initially limited to two years, starting as soon as possible. The Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon is located in Geesthacht, near Hamburg, Germany and in Teltow, near Berlin. You can find more information at http://www.hereon.de. The place of employment is in Geesthacht, Germany.
