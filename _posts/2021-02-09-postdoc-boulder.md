**Postdoctoral Position in Ocean Biogeochemistry at the University of Colorado Boulder**

We invite applications for a postdoctoral researcher<https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/PostDoctoral-Associate/28572> to participate in the study of extreme changes in the Earth system and their impacts on ocean biogeochemistry. This effort is part of two larger projects that aim to describe the impact of extreme events on the Earth system, such as the end-Cretaceous asteroid event or a hypothetical nuclear conflict.

The postdoctoral researcher will join a welcoming, collaborative, supportive, and diverse group of students and researchers who share interests in ocean biogeochemistry, and regularly interact with ocean biogeochemical modelers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder during their appointment.  Specific job activities will be influenced by applicant interests but may include the simulation, analysis, and development of the Marine Biogeochemistry Laboratory (MARBL) component of the NCAR Community Earth System Model.

A Ph.D. in oceanography or a related field is required.  The ideal candidate will have experience with ocean biogeochemical modeling and strong quantitative and statistical skills.  The initial appointment will be for one year, with an opportunity for renewal.

Our research group is engaged in activities that aim to improve equity, diversity, and inclusion in the geosciences.  We particularly welcome applications from candidates whose background and/or work experience align with serving underrepresented or underserved communities (as this relates to the sciences).

To apply, please submit the following materials through CU Boulder Jobs<https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/PostDoctoral-Associate/28572>:

  1.  Curriculum vitae
  2.  Cover Letter
  3.  Transcripts/Proof of Degree
  4.  Statement describing your commitment to and efforts in increasing equity, diversity, and inclusion in STEM
  5.  Contact information for 3 references.

Review of applications will begin on March 22, and continue until the position is filled.
