Kiel University and GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel
aims to attract more qualified women to professorships.
The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at Kiel University, and
GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel invite applications
for a Junior Professorship (W 1) in Physical Oceanography
with temporary civil service status for an initial period of four years (first
phase) to start at the earliest possible time.
The future position holder is expected to represent the field of Physical
Oceanography in both research and teaching.

The junior professorship (W 1) is based at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre
for Ocean Research Kiel (www.geomar.de) in the research unit “Physical
Oceanography” which is part of the research division “Ocean Circulation
and Climate Dynamics.”

The junior professor is expected to initiate and lead excellent and internationally
recognized research in the field of Physical Oceanography.
Applicants’ research interests should lie in the area of process-oriented
observational physical oceanography and comparative model-data
analysis. They should align with the research profile of the GEOMAR
Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and the Physical Oceanography
research unit. Possible areas of research focus include: ocean and
climate dynamics, wind-driven and thermohaline circulation, water mass
transformation, mesoscale and submesoscale variability, internal waves,
mixing processes, and atmosphere-ocean interactions. A particular interest
in applying various modern observational methods (e.g., research
expeditions, moorings, gliders, turbulence probes), in modern data analysis,
artificial intelligence, data science methods, or in the integration of
data and models into digital twins of the ocean is highly desirable. Active
participation in research collaborations within the research division is
expected. Interdisciplinary cooperation with other research groups at Kiel
University, especially within the Kiel Marine Science (KMS) framework,
as well as with GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, is
explicitly encouraged.

A completed university degree, a doctorate/PhD in Physical Oceanography
or a related discipline, and internationally peer-reviewed publications
in the field of Physical Oceanography are required. Experience in
academic teaching and in successfully acquiring third-party funding is
an advantage. International collaborations within and outside the EU are
welcome.

The professorship includes teaching in English and, if applicable, in
German within the Kiel Bachelor’s and Master’s programs in “Physics of
the Earth System” and “Climate Physics.” A suitable teaching concept for
these programs must be submitted with the application.

Reference is made to the recruitment requirements set out in § 64 of the
Higher Education Act of the State of Schleswig-Holstein. If the interim
evaluation of the first phase of the junior professorship is positive, it is
intended to extend the temporary civil servant position for an additional
two years (second phase). Further information can be found on the
website www.berufungen.uni-kiel.de (in German).

Kiel University and GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel
are striving to increase the number of female scientists in research and
teaching and therefore expressly encourages qualified women to apply.
Women will be given priority if their aptitude, qualifications and professional
performance are of equal value.

Kiel University and GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel
are committed to the employment of people with disabilities: Applications
from severely disabled persons and their equals will be given preferential
treatment if they have the appropriate qualifications.
We expressly welcome applications from people with a migration
background. Application photographs are not required and we expressly
request that you refrain from submitting any.

Applications including the usual documents (curriculum vitae with list
of publications, if applicable list of externally funded projects and list of
courses taught, copies of academic degrees, a compelling research and
teaching concept [max. 6 pages in total], and two references) should
be submitted, indicating both private and institutional contact details
(address, phone number, and email), by December 14, 2025 — preferably
in a single PDF file via email to bewerbung@mnf.uni-kiel.de — to:
Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Christian-
Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Olshausenstr. 40, 24098 Kiel, Germany.

Prof. Dr. Peter Brandt (pbrandt@geomar.de).
