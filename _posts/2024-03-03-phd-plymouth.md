The University of Plymouth is offering a 3.5-years PhD investigating the morphological variability of the different gravel barrier typologies.

This PhD is integrated within the multi-institutional #gravelbeach project. The PhD project will involve using novel and multidisciplinary approaches to combine remote sensing observations (2D LiDAR), data science techniques and numerical modelling for different UK gravel beaches. 

This is an exciting chance to be part of a progressive and cutting-edge University in a beautiful location and work within a supportive team of world-leading coastal researchers, the Coastal Processes Research Group (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/coastal-processes). The successful candidate will have the opportunity to participate in a research placement at the University of Bath. The PhD project will equip the student for a career in coastal and climate research, data science and consultancy.

Applications close on 26 April and start date is on 01 October 2024. More information as well as the application procedure can be found here:
