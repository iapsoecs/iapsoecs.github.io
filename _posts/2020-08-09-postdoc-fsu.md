A postdoctoral researcher position is available in physical oceanography/air-sea interaction in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science at Florida State University. The appointment is initially for one year, with the possibility of extension based on funding and acceptable performance. The postdoctoral researcher will be part of an NSF-funded project investigating the impact of sub-annual variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation on the Gulf Stream and the atmosphere. The study will have both theoretical and modelling components, including analysis of an existing eddy-resolving model ensemble as well as the design and execution of further simulations. This project is part of an international effort with Imperial College London, UK.



Job Responsibility: The individual is expected to conduct independent, high-quality research, including the publication of papers and presentation of work at conferences both nationally and internationally. The postdoctoral researcher will also work collaboratively with Imperial College London, UK.



Qualifications: A PhD in physical oceanography, air-sea interaction, or closely related field is required. Proficiency with data analysis is essential; experience with modelling is desirable but not indispensable. Strong verbal and written communication skills in English and the ability to work effectively within an interdisciplinary research team are required.



The position is available from October 1, 2020, and will remain open until filled. Interested applicants should apply at https://jobs.fsu.edu.



Informal inquiries should be made to Rhys Parfitt (rparfitt@fsu.edu<mailto:rparfitt@fsu.edu>) or William Dewar (wdewar@fsu.edu<mailto:wdewar@fsu.edu>).
