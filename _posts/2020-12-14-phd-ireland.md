PHD Opportunity for a Cullen Scholarship in Wave Modelling

The DeWaPic (Decadal wave prediction for the Irish coast) project will investigate the coastal wave impacts on Irish coasts on the decadal and climatological scale with the aim of establishing a framework of models, based on the existing framework available at the Marine Institute, and develop a new coastal impact model for the Irish coastal zone. The aim is to generate statistical information on how waves will change on time-scales from years to multiple decades around the Irish coast. The student will work jointly with Maynooth University and the Marine Institute.
