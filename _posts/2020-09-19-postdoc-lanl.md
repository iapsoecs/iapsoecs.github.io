We are seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher to work on scale-aware ocean eddy parameterizations within the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). This position is for 2 years (with the possibility of a 3rd-year extension) in our modeling group at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, located in beautiful Northern New Mexico, USA.

Please see the full postdoc job description for more information:

The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work closely with E3SM project scientists, and will have the opportunity to collaborate with scientists engaged in the multi-institution Climate Process Team <https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/> on ocean eddy energetics <https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/> (ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io). We expect that the successful candidate will help to define specific science goals that are compatible with these broader requirements. Feel free to contact Dr. Luke Van Roekel (lvanroekel@lanl.gov) for further questions about the project or the position.
