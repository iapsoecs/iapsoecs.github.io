I am pleased to announce a fully funded 4-year PhD position at the Delft University of Technology (The Netherlands) in collaboration with the Alfred Wegener Institute (Germany). Apply here by January 21, 2026:
https://careers.tudelft.nl/job/Delft-PhD-Position-in-Ocean-Dynamics-and-Climate-Impacts-from-High-Resolution-Models-and-Observations-2628-CD/1347769657/?utm_campaign=2889&utm_source=linkedin-en 

 

## What you will do

You will combine cutting-edge high-resolution climate models and observations (gliders and CTDs) to uncover how the Arctic Ocean circulation will evolve in the coming decades, and implications for climate at lower latitudes. If desired, you will also have the opportunity to expand the observational dataset by participating in a research cruise in the Arctic Ocean.

 

## What you will study

Over the past decades, the Arctic Ocean circulation has changed significantly, in part due to a large reduction in sea ice extent. The resulting ocean currents risk delivering a greater amount of fresh waters to the sub-Arctic regions, with potential impact on the global ocean circulation. In this work, you will use mesoscale-resolving simulations and new observations in the Arctic Ocean to uncover these air-sea-ice interactions, extreme freshening events, and upcoming trends. 

 

## What you will gain

- Deep knowledge in climate science
- Processing and deriving interpretation from large datasets
- Combining climate models and observations
- Seagoing experience (if desired)
