JOB SUMMARY

The coastal biogeochemical dynamics lab in the Department of the Marine Sciences located on the Avery Point campus at the University of Connecticut invites applications for a Postdoctoral Researcher. The successful candidate will help resource managers of the northern California Current Ecosystem be ready to deal with future climate change, by advancing our understanding of how multiple stressors (Ocean acidification (OA), hypoxia, increasing temperatures, and harmful algal blooms (HABs)) are likely to impact important ecosystems in the future. This position will provide an opportunity to improve the understanding of the controls over regional evolution of multiple stressors through an analysis of an operational high-resolution intra-seasonal coastal ocean forecast model adapted to project regional ocean conditions through dynamical downscaling resulting in continuous output spanning over 100 years. They will work with this model output, analyzing and delivering the relevant information to coastal communities that rely on this information for planning and decision-making. They will work as part of the team of scientists that includes collaborators at NOAA PMEL, OSU, UW, and Tribal partners. This multi-disciplinary team is working with the state and tribal Dungeness crab fishery in Washington and Oregon to recommend management strategies that will help sustain the fishery despite these projected changes in the future. Visit our lab website (https://samanthasiedlecki.wixsite.com/coastalbiogeodynlab) for more information about our research. The successful candidate will have a working knowledge of ocean biogeochemical cycling including carbon, oxygen, and nutrient cycles in coastal environments. Preference will be given to candidates with experience and expertise in the analysis of large data sets. The position will be located at the regional campus at Avery Point working predominately with the laboratory of Samantha Siedlecki.

Founded in 1881, UConn is a Land Grant and Sea Grant institution and member of the Space Grant Consortium. It is the state?s flagship institution of higher education and includes a main campus in Storrs, CT, four regional campuses throughout the state, and 13 Schools and Colleges, including a Law School in Hartford, and Medical and Dental Schools at the UConn Health campus in Farmington. The University has approximately 10,000 faculty and staff and 32,000 students, including nearly 24,000 undergraduates and over 8,000 graduate and professional students. UConn is a Carnegie Foundation R1 (highest research activity) institution, among the top 25 public universities in the nation. Through research, teaching, service, and outreach, UConn embraces diversity and cultivates leadership, integrity, and engaged citizenship in its students, faculty, staff, and alumni. UConn promotes the health and well-being of citizens by enhancing the social, economic, cultural, and natural environments of the state and beyond. The University serves as a beacon of academic and research excellence as well as a center for innovation and social service to communities. UConn is a leader in many scholarly, research, and innovation areas. Today, the path forward includes exciting opportunities and notable challenges. Record numbers of undergraduate applications and support for student success have enabled the University to become extraordinarily selective.

The Avery Point regional campus was established in 1967 and is just a short drive from both New York City and Boston. The Department of Marine Sciences is located on the Avery Point Campus in Groton, Connecticut right on the waters of Long Island Sound. Our program offers the intimacy and support of a small campus, coupled with the resources of a top-notch public university and internationally renowned scientists.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

  *   Analyze regional simulations for the coastal ocean equipped with biogeochemistry and evaluate model performance using existing observational data.
  *   Quantify a time series of historical and projected changes in collaboration with the team for multi-stressor variables in habitats and time periods relevant for crab.
  *   Publish research in peer-reviewed journals and present results at national and international conferences.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

  *   Doctoral degree in oceanography, or a closely related field.
  *   Technical training or practical experience in programming (Python, Matlab, or similar).
  *   Experience with model analysis and evaluation or large observational data set equivalent.

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS

  *   Experience with ocean biogeochemical cycling including carbon, oxygen, and/or nutrient cycles through courses and/or research experience.
  *   Experience successfully collaborating in a team environment.
  *   Excellent written and oral communication skills.
  *   Publications related to the third minimum qualifications.
  *   Research experience with forecasts or projections.
  *   Experience with engaged research (e.g. research that incorporates input from communities who the research outcomes will impact and involves such communities as equal partners throughout the research process).

APPOINTMENT TERMS

The initial appointment is for one year, with the possibility of renewal based on performance and funding. Salary and benefits are competitive. The position will be located at the regional campus at Avery Point working predominately with the laboratory of Samantha Siedlecki.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT
