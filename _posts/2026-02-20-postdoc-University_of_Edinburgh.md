 Please see below two postdoctoral research opportunities at the University of Edinburgh in the topic of Greenland ice sheet-ocean interactions.


1. Postdoctoral Research Associate (2.5-year position) in Greenland Ice Sheet-ocean interaction as part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project 7 (ISMIP7). ISMIP7 aims to establish consensus estimates of future sea level contribution from ice sheets. The postdoc will work with the Greenland ice-ocean focus group of ISMIP7 to deliver the ocean boundary conditions needed by ice sheet modelers, to analyse how the ocean around Greenland may change, and to better understand the role of the ocean in Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss. More details on ISMIP7 are at https://www.ismip.org/home and for further details and to apply https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/13674


2. Postdoctoral Research Associate (7-month position) in glacial fjord modelling as part of the Fjord Dynamics and Modulation of Ice/Ocean Exchange (FjordMIX) project. FjordMIX aims to advance understanding of ice-ocean interaction through the development of a fjord box modelling framework and its application on an ice-sheet wide scale. We now have a published box model, and the postdoc will therefore work primarily on its application in idealised or real-world settings, to quantify at a continental scale the role of fjords in ocean heat delivery to the ice and/or freshwater release to the ocean. More details on FjordMIX are at https://glaciology.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/projects/fjordmix and https://github.com/fjord-mix/fjordrpm For further details and to apply https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/13758


The anticipated start date for both roles is 1 September 2026, but some flexibility can be offered. The closing date for both roles is 4 March.
