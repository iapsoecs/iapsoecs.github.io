From fundamental research to practical applications, the interdisciplinary research spectrum covers a unique range.
Postdoc
in Hybrid ML/Physical Modelling for Earth Science
Reference code: 50066041_2 â€“ 2021/KS 10
Commencement date: as soon as possible
Application deadline: August 29nd, 2021
The place of employment is Geesthacht (near Hamburg).
This position is designed for a curious and driven Postdoc to focus on challenging and impactful research, supported by extensive on-site expertise and top-notch computational resources, with minimal administrative or teaching duties. The ideal candidate would be an ML expert first and foremost, with knowledge of numerical integration and geoscientific modelling welcome but not essential. However, geoscientists with experience and a publication record in ML are also encouraged to apply. The position is initially limited to three years.
Equality of opportunity is an important part of our personnel policy. We would therefore strongly encourage qualified women to apply for the position.
Your tasks
* develop hybrid methods that combine deep learning with physical models for describing the ocean and atmospheric physics (fluid dynamics, radiation, turbulence, etc.)
* integrate ML-based model components and algorithms in PyTorch with existing climate and weather models in FORTRAN
* validate new algorithms at scale using large-scale observational datasets
* absorb and synthesize knowledge from machine learning, numerical modelling and Earth science
* write, publish and present your research in scientific journals and at conferences
Your profile
* PhD in mathematics, physics, computer science or the geosciences
* previous ML publications
* solid background in the mathematical foundations of ML (linear algebra, probability, etc.)
Severely disabled persons and those equaling severely disabled persons who are equally suitable for the position will be considered preferentially within the framework of legal requirements.
Interested?
Then we are looking forward to receiving your comprehensive application documents indicating the reference number 2021/KS 10.
