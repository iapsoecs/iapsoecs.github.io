 Hi everyone,

Dalhousie University is currently seeking a postdoctoral fellow candidate to work on the large collaborative project UNCERTAIN-SEA, associated with the Transforming Climate Action program (https://www.ofi.ca/programs/transform-climate-action), with collaborators across Canada and the globe. The candidate will work on various aspects of air-sea interactions (e.g., coastal boundary layer cloud physics and dynamics, air-sea energy and carbon exchange) using observational data (e.g. MicroPulse LiDaR, ceilometer, eddy covariance fluxes) to better understand the role of the ocean in the Earth’s carbon and energy budget. A background in atmospheric science or oceanography is required. Dalhousie University is located in the vibrant oceanside city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada (www.dal.ca) and welcomes 21,000 students from across the country and more than 115 countries around the world. Dalhousie is one of Canada’s leading research universities and has a global reputation for excellence in ocean sciences.

The ocean's carbon cycle plays a major role in controlling the level of CO2 in the atmosphere and, hence, Earth's climate. It is also central to energy transfer within the ocean ecosystem. The UNCERTAIN-SEA project aims to improve the understanding and quantification of the exchanges, transformations, and pathways through which the oceanic carbon cycle and Earth's climate system interact, both today as well as in the past. The candidate will contribute to the Transforming Climate Action program, which is carried out by an inter-institutional group of researchers from Dalhousie University, Universiteì de Queìbec aÌ Rimouski, Laval University, and Memorial University. The candidate will be co-advised by Manuel Helbig, Rachel Chang, and Xiaoli Zhou at the Department of Physics and Atmospheric Science at Dalhousie University.

## Project start:

2025 (as soon as possible)
## Required qualifications:

Applicants should hold a PhD in atmospheric science, oceanography, or a related field, awarded by the time they begin the PDF.  Applicants should be interested in interdisciplinary ocean and climate research. Field work may be involved with this position.
Expected Salary: Applicants can expect around $60,000/year. PDF funding is for 2 years with a possibility for renewal for another year.

## Application process:

Candidates should provide a cover letter including a description of their research interests, a CV, copies of unofficial transcript, and contact details of two referees. Applications and inquiries should be directed to Manuel Helbig (manuel.helbig@dal.ca), Rachel Chang (rachel.chang@dal.ca) or Xiaoli Zhou (xiaoli.zhou@dal.ca) with the subject heading “UNCERTAIN-SEA application”. Review of applications will start on March 15, 2025 and will continue until the position is filled.
