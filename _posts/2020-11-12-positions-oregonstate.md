The College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University has openings for 2 PhD students and 1 post-doc focused on field experiments and numerical modeling of small scale processes at the ice/ocean interface.

Tidewater glaciers flow into the ocean, melt, and collapse into a jumble 
of icebergs through complex, dynamic, and interactive processes. 
Understanding this behavior will help put bounds on future changes in 
sea level and ice flow. Recent observations, however, provide evidence 
that tidewater glaciers are melting much faster than current models 
predicted (e.g. Sutherland et al 2019, Jackson et al 2020). Our team is 
leading a major initiative to investigate ice-ocean interaction physics 
at a near-vertical ice face to understand the dynamics responsible for 
this discrepancy and to get more accurate prescriptions of the physics 
in the next generation of climate models. Specifically, we aim to make 
the first observations of boundary layer fluid mechanics and 
morphodynamics that control ice-melt rates at the actively-calving 
terminus of Leconte Glacier, Alaska. These field experiments will be the 
first of their kind, using novel ROV capabilities to make measurements 
of the physics of glacial melt driven by centimeter-scale fluid motions 
in the boundary layer. See more about this project here:

The position descriptions and application submission portal are here:

Applications are due on December 7th for initial review by the team. 
Students will need to also apply to the graduate school after the 
initial review.

This is a very exciting project making measurements at the face of a 
tidewater glacier. We are looking for applicants with strong physics and 
math background and interest in fluid mechanics, boundary layer 
exchange, ice mechanics, and ice morphological change and feedbacks with 
the flow field.
