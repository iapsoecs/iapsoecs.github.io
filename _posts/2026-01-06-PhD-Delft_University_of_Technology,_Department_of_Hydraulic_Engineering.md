## PhD Position High Resolution Ocean Modelling of Greenland Fjords

Are you interested in the interaction between Greenland's glaciers and the surrounding ocean? Come join our team!

 

## Job description

Greenland's fjords is where the ice sheet and the ocean meet: Glaciers slowly flow into the fjords, icebergs calve from the glaciers, and the relatively warm ocean water melts the ice. This two-way interaction takes ice from the ice sheet and puts it in the ocean, causing sea level rise. The fresh water from the melting ice furthermore impacts the regional and global ocean circulation, with potentially large consequences for climate in Europe. Fjords are thus a vital link in the coupled ocean-ice system, but the interaction between the ocean, glaciers, ice bergs, and sea ice, and the link with the larger-scale ocean cirulation, are poorly understood. In this project, you will set up high resolution, realistic numerical simulations of Greenland fjords, and study the ocean dynamics and the interaction with ice. This project is a collaboration between the TU Delft, Utrecht University and the Alfred Wegener Institute (Germany), and you will have the opportunity for research visits to AWI during this project.

 

This vacancy is positioned within the Environmental Fluid Mechanics section in the globally recognized Department of Hydraulic Engineering (HE), known for its excellence in education, research, and career development, addressing key challenges like climate change, energy transition, and biodiversity loss. The department boasts cutting-edge facilities, a collaborative culture, and a diverse team, including 68 permanent staff, and over 100 PhD students and postdocs driving innovative research.   

 

## Job requirements 

* An MSc degree in Physical Oceanography, Environmental Fluid Mechanics, (Climate) Physics, Meteorology, Civil Engineering, or another relevant discipline involving Fluid Dynamics.
* Demonstrable affinity with studying the physics of the ocean and preferably with polar oceanography.
* Experience with numerical modelling.
* Excellent ability to communicate in both written and spoken English.
* Good organisational skills and ability to work independently and in a team.
