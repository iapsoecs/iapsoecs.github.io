The Gulf of Maine Research Institute (https://gmri.org/) (GMRI) is a
mid-sized, interdisciplinary nonprofit located on the waterfront of
Portland, Maine whose mission is to develop and deliver collaborative
solutions to global ocean challenges. GMRI is seeking qualified candidates
to establish a new research group that investigates
climate-zooplankton-upper trophic interactions across spatial and temporal
scales in the Gulf of Maine and adjacent Large Marine Ecosystems. The
successful candidate will have experience with: (a) field-based
experimental design and data collection, (b) in-lab analytical approaches,
and (c) zooplankton modeling and forecasting to examine temporal and
spatial variability in distribution, community structure, and ecology, with
a focus on how these are affected by climate change, ecosystem conditions,
and anthropogenic stressors. A strong quantitative background in, and
technical knowledge of, zooplankton biology and ecology is preferred.

Salary Range: $90,000- $120,000
