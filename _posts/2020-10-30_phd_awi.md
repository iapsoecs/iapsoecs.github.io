For the project "Energy transfers in gravity currents" within the DFG-funded "Sonderforschungsbereich" (CRC) TRR 181 "Energy transfers in Atmosphere and Ocean", the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Germany offers two PhD positions, one in physical oceanography and one in numerical ocean modelling.

The PhD-work will be focussed on the Weddell Sea Bottom Water (WSBW) gravity current, which is fed by dense water formation on the continental shelves of Weddell Sea, and supplies the densest waters to the global ocean. The energy transfers in the WSBW current include phenomena such as mesoscale eddies, tides, tidally generated internal gravity waves (IGWs) and shear instabilities. Using observational and numerical modelling efforts we will analyse the physical processes involved in driving energy transfers across the scales, dissipation of kinetic energy, and mixing.
