The Institute of Earth Sciences in the Faculty of Science at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem seeks outstanding candidates for multiple tenure track faculty positions in all areas of Earth Sciences and at all levels, beginning in the summer or autumn of 2022. Candidates must have a Ph.D. degree in a field of Earth Sciences. The ideal candidate will have significant post-doctoral experience, though outstanding candidates at early stages of their post-doctoral research will also be considered.

Candidates will be evaluated on the basis of their academic credentials, their potential for undertaking ground-breaking research and their commitment to teaching and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. Successful candidates are expected to establish and lead an independent research group pursuing a state-of-the-art research program and to contribute to the undergraduate and graduate teaching programs.

A review of applications will begin on October 15, 2021. Late applications may be considered if the positions have not already been filled.

Each application should include the following documents in PDF format, with each item as a separate PDF file: (1) A curriculum vitae. (2) A list of publications, including an explanation of your contribution to each multi-authored publication. (3) A scientific biography of 2-4 pages summarizing your achievements. (4) A research proposal detailing your research plans for the next several years and on a separate page the approximate laboratory space and instruments needed for your research. (5) A list of your teaching interests, including names and short descriptions of potential courses, both for core undergraduate and advanced subjects. Also include in this document a description of your previous teaching experiences (if any) and teaching evaluations as available. (6) Three representative publications of your work (in press papers are allowed). (7) Recommendation letters from all of your Ph.D. and postdoctoral advisors. These letters should be sent by only the advisors directly to Pr
 of. Ari Matmon. It is the responsibility of the candidate to verify that the letters have been submitted. (8) A list of five referees who are experts in your field and who may be approached by the Faculty of Science to independently evaluate your qualifications for the position. Please describe the level of your acquaintance with the suggested referees and include at least two referees with whom you have not collaborated. Please do not approach these referees directly.

Please send all the application materials to Prof. Ari Matmon (arimatmon@mail.huji.ac.il <mailto:arimatmon@mail.huji.ac.il>). If you do not receive a response soon after submission, please resend the materials copying Ms. Ruth Lischinski (ruthli@savion.huji.ac.il <mailto:ruthli@savion.huji.ac.il>).
