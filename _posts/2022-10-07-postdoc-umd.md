The University of Maryland Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science is seeking a
postdoctoral researcher to study entrainment and subduction between the ocean surface
boundary layer and interior. The postdoc will develop theory and run Large-Eddy-Simulations
(LES) to determine how tracer exchanges are modified by the interaction between
submesoscales, Langmuir circulations, and turbulence. A background in physical
oceanography is required, with preference given to candidates with strong experience in ocean
dynamics and numerical modeling. The position will be located at the University of Maryland,
College Park, working with Dr. Jacob Wenegrat, with significant opportunities for close
collaboration with Dr. Baylor Fox-Kemper (Brown), Dr. Jay Brett (JHU-APL), and other project
team members.

This is a 3-year postdoctoral position (subject to satisfactory ongoing performance and the
continued availability of funding), with potential opportunity for extension. The position can
begin immediately, although candidates with preferred start dates as late as summer 2023 will
be considered.

To apply please submit a brief cover letter (explaining interest and relevant qualifications), CV
(including list of publications), and contact information for 3 references directly by email to
Jacob Wenegrat (wenegrat@umd.edu). Only references for shortlisted candidates will be
contacted. Review of applications will begin immediately, and the position will remain open
until filled.

The UMD Ocean Dynamics group is committed to creating an inclusive and equitable group
environment, and to working towards increasing diversity in oceanography. More information,
including a group expectations document, is available online: http://wenegrat.github.io/.

Questions about the position may be directed to Jacob Wenegrat (wenegrat@umd.edu<mailto:wenegrat@umd.edu>).



Minimum Qualifications:

* PhD in physical oceanography, fluid dynamics, or other related subject by start date

Preferred Qualifications:

* Experience with LES

* Proficiency with high-performance computing

* Prior research focus on submesoscale dynamics, turbulence, or surface waves is a plus


Duties and Responsibilities:

* Develop new tracer-inversion methods for use in LES
