A 5-year PhD student opportunity is available at the University of
Southern California, in the Climate Dynamics group
(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://climdyn.usc.edu__;!!KGKeukY!1WcQV9A6iR2YDV4QeVt3wged2C30e9eQAhAfNm630xS8vMvuPVnYd25HpzEscrN2U6yvljs205lyIQ7RtON_$  ), starting in July 2023. There is significant
flexibility in defining the scope of the research, in the broad field
of paleoclimate dynamics and data science. Applicants should have a
solid background in physics/applied mathematics/atmospheric science,
oceanography or related fields. Familiarity with open-source code
development, particularly Python, is a plus.

USC is an equal opportunity, affirmative action employer (see here for
details). To apply, please send a cover letter explaining your
interest in the topic, relevant qualifications, a curriculum vitae and
(if available) examples of past research to Dr Julien Emile-Geay
(julieneg@usc.edu). Official applications will take place by Jan 1,
2023 (instructions here), but a prior conversation is strongly
encouraged (see this blog post). GREs are *not* considered in — and
therefore not required for — the application, but applicants should
demonstrate familiarity with (and enthusiasm for) the lab’s research
themes.
