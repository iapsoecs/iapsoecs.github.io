CMCC Position
Job Opening cod. 12361

(Post-Doc/Junior Scientist)
Research position on Global Ocean Reanalysis
(Deadline: May 31st 2022)

The CMCC Foundation is a scientific research center on climate change and its interactions with the environment, the society, the world of business and policy makers.
Our work aims to stimulate sustainable growth, protect the environment and develop strategies for the adaptation and mitigation of climate change.

Our Division of Ocean Modelling and Data Assimilation Division is looking for a new position of Post-Doc/Junior Scientist, that will perform research, development and assessment of the CMCC eddy-permitting global ocean reanalysis system (C-GLORS) that combines the general circulation model NEMO with in-house ocean data assimilation system (OceanVar) https://www.cmcc.it/it/models/c-glors-the-cmcc-global-ocean-physical-reanalysis-system .

The CMCC C-GLORS is part of the Copernicus Marine Service  Global Ocean Ensemble Reanalysis product at 1/4 degree resolution https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/product-detail/GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_PHY_001_031/INFORMATION .

The successful candidate will be asked to support the implementation, production, and the validation of a new global ocean Reanalysis using the latest version of the NEMO model and several OceanVar developments (e.g. sea-ice variable assimilation, new unbias procedures, optimizations of the background/observation error covariance matrix, etc.)

The job location is CMCC Site in Bologna (BO),Italy.

We are looking for a motivated person with the following requirements:

    PhD or equivalent experience in Physics, Physical Oceanography, Applied Mathematics, or related disciplines;

    Knowledge of UNIX/Linux operating systems and script languages;
    Fluency in English

The following experiences are highly desirable:

    Experience with data assimilation techniques for geophysical fields
    Hands-on experience with ocean numerical modeling, knowledge of NEMO modeling platform being an advantage;
    Experience with reanalysis production systems, from input data quality control to evaluation of the quality;
    Experience of parallel programming on supercomputers and knowledge of the NetCDF libraries;
    Good communication skills and ability to work in an interdisciplinary team

Belonging to legally protected categories (ex L. 68/99) will constitute a preferential condition.
