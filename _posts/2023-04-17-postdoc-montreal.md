Employer: Université du Quebec à Montreal (UQAM)

Location: Montreal, Quebec and/or Edmonton, Alberta, Canada

Education Level: PhD

Job type: Postdoctoral Fellow

Salary: up to 60,000 CA$ negotiable and depending on experience

Term: Full Time, 1 year, with possibility for renewal

Applicants for these positions should have a PhD in physics, climate sciences, meteorology, oceanography or a related field. The postdoctoral candidates are expected to have strong computational skills, a good publication record, a high level of independence, curiosity and creativity, and an interest in working in an international and interdisciplinary research environment. The successful candidate will work on the project Arctic-Tropical Teleconnections in the climate system (ArcTrop) with Profs. Francesco S.R. Pausata and Anne de Vernal at UQAM and Prof. Paul Myers at the University of Alberta to conduct high-resolution simulations using both ocean (NEMO) and atmospheric (GEM or WRF) regional models to address fundamental questions to understanding the physical mechanisms underlying polar amplification and its connection with vegetation changes and low latitude climate. 
In-depth knowledge of Climate Modelling is required and knowledge of NEMO is an advantage.

The postdoctoral fellow will be hosted either at the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences of UQAM in Montreal or at the University of Alberta in Edmonton with the possibility of working at both campuses. The candidate will benefit from direct interaction with the extended research group at the Center for the Study and Simulation of Climate at Regional Scale (ESCER) and the Geotop Research Center on the Dynamics of the Earth System. 
 
The candidate will join a broad, equitable, inclusive and diverse group of researchers. We welcome applications from all qualified persons, and we encourage women, First Nations, Métis and Inuit, members of visible minority groups, persons with disabilities, persons of any sexual orientation or gender identity and expression, and all those who may contribute to the further diversification of ideas to apply.

About Montreal:

The city of Montréal is the second largest city in Canada and is world-renowned as a centre of culture, creativity, knowledge and innovation. In 2017 the city celebrated its 375th anniversary, along with Canada’s 150th birthday. The combination of Indigenous, North American and European influences gives this city a unique cultural and architectural flavour. It enjoys an outstanding reputation for its arts scene, including (among others) the world-renowned Jazz Festival which takes place in late June – early July each year. Montréal’s cosmopolitan character is reflected in the vibrant and diverse communities that make up the city, and its excellent international cuisine.
Montréal is well known as a vibrant, safe city and  it was also the first North American city to be designated a UNESCO City of Design in 2006. The city has over 1000 parks and green spaces and 450 km of bike paths. Central to the city’s green spaces are Mont-Royal in the centre of Montréal, the parks situated on the islands of the St. Lawrence River, and Montréal’s extensive Botanic Garden.
Montréal is easily accessible from all parts of the world, with excellent air links. The airport is 20 minutes’ journey from the downtown core. The city boasts an efficient public transit system comprising a network of bus and Metro (subway) routes.

About Edmonton:

Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta and is North America's northernmost city with a metropolitan population over one million. It is only few hours away from the Rocky Mountains and the Jasper / Banff National Park. Edmonton hosts several large festivals each year, for example The TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival takes place in late June and, along with Montreal, were the first jazz festivals in Canada; or the Edmonton International Fringe Festival, held in mid-August, is the largest fringe theatre festival in North America. Also in August Edmonton hosts the Edmonton Folk Music Festival, the fourth major folk festival in Canada.
