Please do not hesitate to forward our post-doctoral programme for young scientists within your respective communities.

2022 edition

Post-doctoral program for young scientists

The aim of the program is to give creative young scientists the opportunity to develop their own research project in one of the ISblue laboratories (Western Brittany, France).
 
ISblue themes range from the coastal environment to the deep sea, bringing together research in all disciplines: ocean and geosciences, ecosystems, new technologies for observation, and the human societies living near the sea.

Fellows are appointed for two years.
Funding includes salary and support for travel or small equipment and supplies.

Four fellowships will be awarded in 2022.

Deadline for applications: Sunday April 30th, 2022

ISblue strongly encourages you to apply for both the ISblue and BIENVENÜE COFUND programs, if you are eligible for both (conditions differ).

Note that the application deadline for BIENVENÜE is earlier (february 15th)
