The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON)  for  research  and  education (https://lumcon.edu) seeks to hire multiple Assistant Professors as part of a multi-year faculty expansion. We are interested in hiring interdisciplinary scientists whose research addresses fundamental and applied questions in the coastal, near-shore marine, and oceanographic sciences. We invite qualified candidates within these broad disciplines whose research uses observational, modelling, theoretical, and/or experimental approaches to apply for three (3) open positions based at the DeFelice Marine Center in Cocodrie, Louisiana. Applications will be accepted until the positions are filled, but we will begin reviewing applications on March 1, 2026.


## Institution

LUMCON is a program of the Louisiana Board of Regents serving as a statewide academic and research Consortium representing over 40 universities and colleges across Louisiana. LUMCON’s mission is to promote, facilitate and conduct research and education collaborations among Louisiana’s universities in marine and coastal sciences relevant to the sustainability of coastal and marine environments of the U.S. Gulf Coast.

LUMCON provides unparalleled opportunities in coastal, marine, and oceanographic science and education to the research community and public alike. Anchored by a first-rate marine laboratory, the DeFelice Marine Center, LUMCON is embedded in Louisiana’s dynamic wetland environment and conveniently located on a gateway to the open waters of the Gulf. LUMCON operates a world-class fleet of research vessels unmatched on the US Gulf Coast. In 2023, LUMCON expanded its programs through the opening of a maritime research and outreach facility (Blue Works) on the Maritime Campus in Houma. In 2025, a large boat slip and bulkhead project was completed on the Maritime Campus. We recently held the ground breaking for a new Marine Operations Center that will open in 2027 and a keel-laying for the

state’s new flagship, 125-foot RV Pelican II, which will also be delivered in 2027.


## Assistant Professor Positions in Coastal and Marine Science / Oceanography 

We are seeking interdisciplinary scientists whose research addresses fundamental and applied questions in the coastal, near-shore marine, or oceanographic sciences who are interested in developing a world-class research program to apply for these positions. Research subject specialties may include, but are not limited to all disciplines of oceanography, community ecology (e.g., deep-sea, coral, wetland, barrier island), marine geology, marine fisheries, aquaculture, environmental toxicology, microbiology, and organic geochemistry. 

Because of the intended connections with on-going LUMCON research programs, proximity to our R/V Acadiana and coastal-class (R/V Pelican and its replacement R/V Pelican II) research vessels, as well as close access to a new regional class research vessel, R/V Gilbert R. Mason, this position will be based at the DeFelice Marine Center (Laboratory) in Cocodrie, Louisiana. 

Candidates should have a strong publication record, a history of funded research, and potential for funding their research, as well as a strong commitment to education and outreach and a demonstrated commitment to student and adult education. Preference will be given to candidates who can clearly demonstrate an existing or planned research program that maximizes the locality and research assets, including the DeFelice Marine Center, Blue Works, and research vessels, and complements and extends the strengths of LUMCON and the Consortium. An academic appointment at one or more of LUMCON’s Consortium universities will be required after the incumbent is hired. 

Positions carry a competitive 9-month salary with 3 additional months possible from grants, strong benefits and retirement packages, and a start-up budget. A six-year review similar to tenure is conducted for promotion to Associate Professor. However, LUMCON is not a tenure-granting institution. 


## Minimum Qualifications 

- Ph.D. in coastal, estuarine, marine, or oceanographic sciences or related field 
- Strong publication record 
- History of funded research 
- Strong commitment to education and outreach 
- Legal authority to work in the United States prior to being hired 


## Ideal Candidate/Preferred Qualifications 

- Post-doctoral research experience 
- Documented leadership in developing a competitive research program 
- Experience in mentoring undergraduate and/or graduate students 


## Essential Duties 

- Establish a regional, national and internationally recognized research program in the coastal, marine and/or oceanographic sciences 
- Develop innovative research ideas relevant to incumbent’s research community 
- Attain research funding from state, federal, or private programs by leading or co-leading competitive proposals 
- Write and publish papers in reputable, peer-reviewed scientific journals describing incumbent’s research advancements 
- Engage in frequent and effective communications with both scientific audiences (e.g., state, national, international scientific meetings) and the general public 
- Mentor undergraduate students (e.g., REU Program) and graduate students as a committee member or chair through one or more of LUMCON’s consortium academic institutions 
- Provide leadership in arranging logistics that include, but not limited to, investigator travel, facility usage, vessel operations engagement, grant management, and conflict resolution 


## Facility 

The LUMCON DeFelice Marine Center, located at the upper end of Terrebonne Bay in the Mississippi River deltaic plain between the Atchafalaya and Mississippi rivers, is in close proximity to numerous habitats including extensive marshes, estuaries, large and small rivers, coastal zone management projects, and the open Gulf. The Center facilities include a seawater system, multiple wet labs, racetrack flume, 

environmental chambers, extensive aquaculture and experimental tank facilities, marsh mesocosm facility, dedicated laboratories for all faculty, and a fleet of research vessels ranging from small boats to a 199-foot regional class research vessel. Blue Works is a new state-of-the-art facility in Houma, Louisiana on our Maritime Campus that provides opportunities for education and research initiatives at the intersection of engineering, technology, industry, and marine science/oceanography. The facility contains research labs, education spaces (including makers labs, fabrication labs, and 3D printing facilities), library, and formal and informal meeting and exhibit spaces. Our research vessel fleet and proximity to the coast facilitate the use of a broad mix of traditional and innovative instruments and observational techniques to make measurements in many settings from open-ocean to coastal regions to trans-Gulf operations. 


## How to Apply 

Submit electronic copies of, 1) a letter of interest; 2) curriculum vita; 3) research statement; 4) a statement on your education and outreach activities/philosophy with examples that illustrate your work in recruiting STEM students; 5) a statement of how your research program would use the location of LUMCON's DeFelice Marine Center and its assets, develop collaborations with faculty at Marine Center, Blue Works, and Consortium member universities, and collaboratively utilize the resources of the Consortium member universities, and if applicable, a statement of aspirations for establishing new sea-going programs; and 6) the name, affiliation, address, phone and email address of three references to Dr. Ken W. Krauss (kkrauss@lumcon.edu), Professor and Associate Director of Science, with the subject line “LUMCON Faculty Application”.
