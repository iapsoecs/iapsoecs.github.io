Two-year post-doctoral scientist position at the UCLouvain, Belgium, on the tipping points of Southern Ocean circulation.

The position is open within the project ‘Tipping Points in the Southern Ocean Overturning (TiPSOO)’ supported by the ESA. A slowdown or a collapse of the Southern Ocean Overturning Circulation would have far reaching consequences, potentially accelerating global warming and sea level rise and triggering ecosystem losses. The goal of the project is to estimate changes in the Southern Ocean overturning circulation and investigate the possibility to detect a potential tipping point using new Earth Observations and modelling results.

In this framework, applications are open for the following position:

Post-doctoral researcher

Starting date: Ideally in June 2025 but can be negotiated
Full time position for 24 months

Net monthly salary: 2900-3300 € (depending on seniority)

Social insurance and the transportation to and from the workplace are also covered.
Location: Earth and Life Institute, Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium.

Frequent interactions with the National Oceanography Centre Southampton, UK, are expected (partner institution in the project )

The candidates must not have spent more than 2 years in Belgium over the last 3 years and should not have obtained their PhD more than 6 years before the starting date of the grant.

The post-doctoral scientist will be responsible for the design and the analysis of sensitivity experiments performed with the Ocean-Sea-Ice model NEMO to detect fingerprints of changes in the Southern Ocean Circulation that could be observed from satellites. The recent evolution of the Southern Ocean Overturning Circulation and its drivers will then be investigated in order to determine if the overturning is already close to a tipping point, if some signs indicate a potential transition in the coming years, and if they can be detected from current observation systems.

Required qualifications:

- To have a PhD in oceanography, climatology or related field;
- To have strong experience in programming and in managing large data sets;
- To have published in peer-reviewed international journals;
- To have demonstrated good verbal and written communication skills in English;
- To have interest in working in a multidisciplinary team environment.

Previous experience in polar oceanography and climate modelling is an asset.

Applicants should send an e-mail to Hugues Goosse (hugues.goosse@uclouvain.be) including (i) a statement of research experience, qualification and interest, (ii) a complete CV including a list of publications, and (iii) the name of two scientists who would agree to send a letter of recommendation

Review of the applications will start March 7 and the call will remain open until the position is filled.
