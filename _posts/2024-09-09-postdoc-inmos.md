Position description: InMOS (Integration of Models and Observations Across Scales) is an international project funded by Schmidt Sciences under the Ocean Biogeochemistry Virtual Institute (OBVI) initiative. The goal of InMOS is to develop a combined multi-scale state estimate of ocean heat, carbon, and oxygen budgets for the past 35 years, with the aim of both reducing uncertainties in these budgets and achieving an unprecedented level of understanding of the physical and biogeochemical processes affecting these interlinked cycles. InMOS is led by Tim DeVries at UC Santa Barbara and Ralph Keeling at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and comprises 11 PIs at multiple institutions across the U.S., Europe, and South Africa.

As part of InMOS, we are looking for a postdoctoral scholar to work on marine biogeochemical modeling and data assimilation under the supervision of Prof. Tim DeVries at UC Santa Barbara. The position involves the development and testing of new ocean biogeochemical models, and assimilating ocean biogeochemical tracers into these models to constrain the mean state and climate-driven variability of the oceanâ€™s carbon, heat, and oxygen cycles. The successful candidate will also collaborate with PIs and postdocs at other InMOS institutions working on various aspects of the project, such as ocean observations, high-resolution modeling and machine learning.
