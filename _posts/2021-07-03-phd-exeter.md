We are looking for a student with strong computational skills and a fascination about our natural world and the place of humans within it, to join a large EU funded project SEACHANGE focused on understanding how our marine ecosystems responded to, or potentially drove, major transitions in human history. These transitions span shifts between fishing and farming in North West Europe, Viking settlement of Iceland and colonialization of Australia, to the advent of whaling off Antarctica.
