What You Will Do

Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is seeking candidates for a postdoctoral appointment in the field of ocean and climate modeling, with a specific focus on water mass transformation and the mechanisms driving the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This position is part of a new multi-institution project (ImPACTS: Improving Projections of AMOC and Collapse Through advanced Simulations) investigating the physical processes governing the stability of the AMOC and aiming to reduce climate model biases using novel analysis techniques. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work closely with world-leading experts in the fields of Physical Oceanography, Machine Learning, and Computational Science. Candidates with experience in modeling and analyzing ocean or climate processes, or with interest in applying Machine Learning techniques to climate analysis, are especially encouraged to apply.

The successful applicant will be expected to produce and analyze global climate simulations with the US DOE's new climate model E3SM (see e3sm.org), publish results in high-impact peer-reviewed journals, and present research work at conferences. The selected candidate will be based at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM, and work with collaborators at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, CA. The term of the appointment is two (2) years, with the option to extend to a third year depending on performance and funding availability.

What You Need

Minimum Job Requirements:

  *   A Ph.D. in applied mathematics, computational science, physics, earth sciences, fluid dynamics, climate modeling, engineering, geophysics, or a closely related field.
  *   Record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals.
  *   Willingness to work productively in a multidisciplinary team environment.

Education/Experience: Ph.D. in a STEM field. Candidates are typically eligible to apply for a LANL postdoctoral position within five years of receiving their Ph.D., and will have completed all Ph.D. requirements by commencement of appointment. Requests for exceptions to the five-year eligibility requirement will be considered.

Desired Qualifications:

  *   Experience with programming languages such as Fortran, C/C++, or Python.
  *   Understanding of ocean physics, large-scale ocean circulation, and / or climate.
  *   Experience working in large-scale, parallel computing environments.
