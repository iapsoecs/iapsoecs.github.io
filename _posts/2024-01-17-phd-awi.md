There are two open PhD positions on Arctic physical oceanography at the Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven / Germany.

 

Both projects target the oceanâ€™s role in sea ice decline in the Arctic. One of the projects will be based on Arctic Ocean observations. Details can be found here: https://jobs.awi.de/Vacancies/1567/Description/2

 

Please direct any questions regarding this position to torsten.kanzow@awi.de and/or benjamin.rabe@awi.de .

 

The second project is based primarily on numerical modeling of the Arctic Ocean. Details are found here: https://jobs.awi.de/Vacancies/1568/Description/2

 

Please direct any questions regarding this position to torsten.kanzow@awi.de and/or qiang.wang@awi.de .

 

Both projects are part of the Collaborative Research Centre 172 on Arctic Amplification (AC3, http://www.ac3-tr.de), a major network of Polar researchers in Germany funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG). Feel free to apply to both projects, if applicable. The deadline for applications is on 31 January following the links given above. We are very much looking forward to hearing from you.
