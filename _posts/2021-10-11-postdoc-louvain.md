**Decadal variability of the Southern Ocean and its contribution to the predictability of the atmosphere-ocean-ice sheet system**

Description of the position :

Post-doctoral researcher

Starting date: 1st of January 2022 but can be negotiated
Full time position for 24 months

Net monthly salary: 2300-2500 € (depending on seniority - this includes social insurances). Transportation to and from workplace is covered.
Location: Earth and Life Institute, Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium (30km southward of Brussels)

The candidates must not have spent more than 2 years in Belgium over the last 3 years and should not have obtained their PhD more than 6 years before the starting date of the grant.

The post-doctoral scientist will contribute to advance understanding of the processes driving the recent variability of the ice-ocean system and how they could lead to predictability at interannual to decadal timescale. He/she will perform and analyse simulations with the global ocean and sea ice model NEMO-LIM and with a new coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice-ice sheet model covering Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, in collaboration with the other scientists working on the PARAMOUR project ( https://www.elic.ucl.ac.be/users/klein/PARAMOUR/index.html ) . Dedicated numerical experiments will be devised and run with those models, including for example (but not limited to): activation or not of explicit melting rates at the ocean-ice shelves boundaries and impact on the ocean / sea ice state; applying a constraint on the model winds (e.g., by nudging towards climatological values) to disentangle thermodynamic from dynamic processes on the sea ice variability; supressing the feedbacks between sea ice and ocean to quantify their role in recent trends.

Required qualifications:

- To have a PhD in climatology or related field;
- To have published in peer-reviewed international journals;
- To have strong experience in programming and in managing large data sets;
- To have demonstrated verbal and written communication skills in English;
- To have interest in working in a multidisciplinary team environment.

Previous experience in polar climate dynamics is an asset.

Applicants should send via e-mail to Hugues Goosse ( hugues.goosse@uclouvain.be ) (i) a statement of research experience, qualification and interest, (ii) a complete CV including a list of publications, and (iii) the name of two scientists who would agree to send a letter of recommendation

Review of the applications will start October 15 and the call is open until the position is filled.
