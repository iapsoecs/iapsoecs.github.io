The Climate Variability Group at the Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences at University of Bologna is looking for a highly motivated, committed, and creative postdoctoral fellow to work for a 2 year period (3 years also possible) on Climate Variability within the ObsSea4Clim project framework (https://obssea4clim.eu/ ).
 
ObsSea4Clim is a European-funded HORIZON project aimed at improving the monitoring, understanding, reporting and projections of essential physical oceanic processes related to climate and changes over time, and of producing related Essential Ocean & Climate Variables (EOV/ECVs) and indicators at regional or sea basin scale. The selected candidate will be tasked with assessing the representation of internal variability of EOV/ECVs from seasonal to multi-decadal time scales in both historical and scenarios simulations from Earth System Models initial-condition large ensembles (ESM-LEs). This novel assessment will allow the correct interpretation of differences between models and observations, which will be attributed to either model misrepresentations or the model’s internal variability. Differences not reconcilable by accounting for the model's internal variability will be investigated in order to draw suggestions for ESM improvements.
 
 
RESPONSIBILITIES

The selected candidate will be responsible for:

    - Performing scientific and statistical analysis on a wide range of ocean data products and models;
    - Presenting research and updates in the project meetings;
    - Writing project reports and scientific articles.

REQUIREMENTS

We are looking for a motivated person with a solid foundation in climate science, coupled with proficiency in programming languages like Python and Bash (Linux). Here is a list of requirements:

    - PhD in climate sciences, oceanography, or atmospheric sciences with experience in the fields of climate and/or oceanography;
    - good knowledge and skills in climate data analysis (preference for Python) and modelling;
    - good knowledge of Unix environnement (e.g., bash);
    - good communication skills and team-working attitude;
    - proficient skills of spoken and written English.

DURATION, COMPENSATION & POTENTIAL BENEFITS

    The appointment period will be initially of 2 years;
    The research fellowship contract offers a gross annual amount of €27,563.10, which is exempt from withholding tax
    This salary is considered competitive within Italian standards.
