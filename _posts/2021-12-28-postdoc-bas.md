The British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK has a Postdoc position for 3.5 years on regional climate modelling of the polar regions.

 

This position is funded by the EU Horizon 2020 project PolarRES (Polar Regions in the Earth System: Role of local-regional scale processes in the changing polar and global climate system).

 

Successful applications will use the regional climate model configuration of the atmosphere-only UK Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) at a grid spacing of 10 km to generate storyline-based high-resolution climate projections of the Arctic and Antarctic from present-day to 2100. These projections will contribute to a novel, detailed, multi-model ensemble of polar climate projections, with other project scientists in PolarRES also contributing projections from a variety of other regional climate models. The multi-model ensemble will then be used to investigate how future storylines influence the polar climate system at high-resolution. You will also work with impact modellers involved in the project to ensure that the multi-model ensemble of polar climate projections are used to generate policy-relevant knowledge covering the impacts of polar climate change on the environment and society.

 

The applicant should have experience using regional climate models, especially over the polar regions and ideally using the MetUM. Strong understanding of the polar climate is also necessary.

The closing date for applications is 9 January 2022.
