JOB SUMMARY

The coastal biogeochemical dynamics lab at the University of Connecticut invites applications for a Research Assistant position to participate in and support a series of regional modeling activities performed in the lab in the general area of coastal ocean prediction. The successful candidate will have an expertise in computational methods, and model evaluation. They will manage, as part of the team, production of model climatologies, historical and forecast/projection simulations.  Preference will be given to candidates with experience with Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and knowledge of Unix systems. Experience with statistical analysis of large data sets is encouraged.  The incumbent will work with the existing team of researchers on the presentation of the results websites, peer-reviewed journal articles, and scientific presentations. The position will be located at the regional campus at Avery Point working with the laboratory of Samantha Siedlecki.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

  *   Implement experiments with existing regional models in ROMS using FORTRAN on a Unix based system;
  *   Analyze model output and evaluate model performance using existing data;
  *   Develop code to produce figures and movies of the output that can be used to disseminate output to the user community and enhance public access
  *   Assist Principal Investigators on the project with the tasks involved with improving the system and quantifying new metrics to better communicate the results on the web.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

  *   MSc in Oceanography, or a closely related field; BS will be considered in combination with equivalent relevant work experience (2 ? 4 years of experience in a related area)
