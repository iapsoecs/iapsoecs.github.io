**Postdoctoral Scholar in Ocean Prediction with Machine Learning**

A minimum three-year postdoctoral scholar position is available to join
the Powell Lab <https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpowellb.oceanmodeling.org%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cmet-jobs%40lists.reading.ac.uk%7Cc32dfd11fe9d496864b008d910d1045c%7C4ffa3bc4ecfc48c09080f5e43ff90e5f%7C0%7C0%7C637559312165635596%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=YcS6DHxWAlHjWSe4Bhsdu1gFCdePEecklTEqfNZWvlM%3D&amp;reserved=0> in the Department of
Oceanography in the School of Ocean and Earth Science Technology at the
University of Hawaii at Manoa. You will join an effort beginning later
this year to develop new methods around physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) to better estimate poorly resolved submesoscale processes in the
ocean. These efforts will be extending to implement near real-time data
assimilation of observations previously unused by traditional 4D-Var.
This effort is one component of a larger, collaborative effort of US and
Taiwanese institutions in the Western Pacific.

The successful candidate will join a dynamic lab environment working on
similar issues and research. The position will be responsible for
performing ocean model simulations, using 4D-Var state-estimation as a
baseline, while helping develop new PINNs to improve parameterization
and estimate the adjoint of the model. This will lead to development of
new techniques, and dynamical analysis of their impact on
predictability. It is expected that the successful candidate will
publish scientific articles and will have opportunities to contribute to
and/or write new funding proposals to develop their own program.
Competitive candidates may come from a domain-specific background
(oceanography) or a technique specific background (machine learning). We
will consider applicants of  nontraditional and tangential fields with
motivation and interest in becoming machine learning experts within
oceanography.


Minimum Qualifications include: Ph.D. or equivalent in physical
oceanography, machine learning, physics, mathematics, ocean engineering,
or related field, ability to work well independently as part of a team,
and strong communication skills both verbal and written. Preferred
candidates will have strong mathematical and computational skills with a
background in machine learning, fluids, or physical oceanography.
Candidates should be motivated to drive new developments in machine
learning within oceanography.

The appointment will be reviewed annually and renewed based upon
performance and funding. Salary is commensurate with qualifications and
experience. Review of applications will begin immediately, and will
proceed until the position is filled. Electronic applications
containing: (1) curriculum vitae; (2) one-page statement of research
interests; (3) one published academic article most indicative of your
work; (4) contact information for three references to
powellb@hawaii.edu. Email verification will be sent upon receipt of your
application, please inquire if receipt is not received. For more
information, please contact Dr. Brian Powell <powellb@hawaii.edu>.

The University of Hawaii is an equal opportunity and affirmative action
employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for
employment without regard to race, color, national origin, religion,
sex, age, veteran status, or disability. Applications from women,
