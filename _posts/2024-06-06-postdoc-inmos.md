InMOS (Integrating Models and Observations across Scales) is a new multi-institution, 5-year project that seeks to improve our understanding of the oceanic budgets of carbon, heat, and oxygen by combining observations, biogeochemical models, and machine learning. 

As part of this project, we have postdoctoral scholar positions available in 10 different institutions across the U.S, Europe, and South Africa. Please share this information and this expression of interest form:
