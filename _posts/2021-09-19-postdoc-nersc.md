A 3-year post-doctoral position is open at the Nansen Center for reconstruction of Arctic sea ice thickness using data assimilation and machine learning. The post doc is fully funded by the Research Council of Norway under the TARDIS grant (Thickness of Arctic sea ice Reconstructed by Data assimilation and artificial Intelligence Seamlessly). The goal is to take benefit from the recent data-rich decade (2010-2020), during which the whole Arctic is covered by satellite data and provide a longer time series of sea ice thickness for the data-sparse decade 2000-2010.

The post-doc will be part of an international research team including NORCE (Tromsø), Uni. Reading (UK) and CEREA (Paris, Fr) with expertise in data assimilation, machine learning techniques, remote sensing and in situ sea ice observations. The post-doc will use the TOPAZ modeling and data assimilation system for the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The TOPAZ system is presently the Arctic component of the European Copernicus Marine Services and is exploited operationally at MET Norway.

Responsibilities

    Identify predictors of sea ice thickness distribution from reanalysis data
    Design, train and validate an emulator of sea ice thickness
    Modify an Ensemble Kalman Filter using machine learning to update the ice thickness distribution
    Publication of results

Start date: June 2022 at the latest. 
Deadline for applications: 15th Dec. 2021.
