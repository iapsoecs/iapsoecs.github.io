The fellow will work on fundamental aspects of Arctic Ocean circulation, using theory, modelling, and observations. Interactions between topography, mean flows and eddies are central for shaping the Arctic Ocean circulation, and possible research topics include: 
•Topographic steering of the large-scale flow, and pathways of the Arctic Atlantic Water.
•Topographic and hydraulic constraints on Arctic Atlantic Water driven basal glacier melt in Greenlandic fjords. 
The project is funded by the Swedish Research Council and is a collaboration with scientists at University of Oslo. We seek applicants with expertise in physical oceanography, geophysical fluid and glacial/ice-sheet dynamics, or climate dynamics.
