The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) is a multidisciplinary center for climate and Earth system research located in Hamburg, Germany. It is one of the premier climate science research institutes in the world. Located in the heart of one of Europe’s most livable and vibrant cities, it provides a highly international and interdisciplinary environment to conduct scientific research as well as access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities. You can also have a virtual tour to our campus.

THE POSITION

The Climate Dynamics Department at MPI-M invites applications for the following position "Group Leader in Climate Dynamics (W-0022 | all genders)" to lead the Idealized Modeling Group, which focuses on the use of model hierarchies and/or idealized experiments to develop and test ideas for fundamental questions in the broad field of large-scale atmospheric dynamics. The research questions to address include, but are not limited to,

    How does inter-hemispheric energy contrasts induce cross-equatorial winds?
    What is the dynamical constraint on equilibrium climate sensitivity?
    What is the mechanism for the hemispheric symmetry in planetary albedo?
    What dynamical constraint determines the weakening of the tropical convective mass flux?
    How do clouds modulate the large-scale atmospheric circulation?

YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

    Design numerical experiments to test different hypotheses
    Supervise doctoral and postdoctoral scholars, as well as research students if the opportunity arises

The position will be offered for a 6 year period, with a review and assessment for permanent employment to take place in the sixth year.
 
YOUR PROFILE

    Ph.D. in Physics, Meteorology, Atmospheric or Climate Sciences or a related discipline by the start date. Preferably with first postdoctoral experience in atmospheric/climate science
    Demonstrated capability to publish top-quality research papers
    Excellent analytical and programming skills
    Intellectual independence
    Willingness and expected ability to guide young scholars
    Fluency in written and spoken English

OUR OFFER

    Participation in a challenging part of science in an international, intellectually stimulating environment
    Access to complex workflows on the bleeding edge of what is technologically possible, as well as working for and with an open-source community
    Very good opportunities for self-realization, freedom in and influence upon the decisions what to do, and how to do it
    Excellent opportunities for further (self-)training and development, self-organized and/or in external events, including supervisory experience
    A network of very experienced and innovative colleagues within the institute, and at partner institutions with a long-proven tradition of sharing knowledge and information
    Possibility for flexible time-management and measures to support work-life balance
    Attractive subsidy for job ticket in Hamburg (DeutschlandJobTicket)

EMPLOYEEMENT CONDITIONS

    Payment will be in accordance with German public service positions depending on qualification (E14 TVöD), including extensive social security plans. The conditions of employment, including upgrades and duration, follow the rules of the Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science and those of the German civil service
    The Max Planck Society strives for gender and diversity equality. We welcome applications from people of all backgrounds
