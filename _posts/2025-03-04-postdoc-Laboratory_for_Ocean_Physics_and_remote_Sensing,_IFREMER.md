Dear colleagues,

An exciting hydrodynamic field campaign will take place on the atoll of Rangiroa from May to September 2025, as part of the French Priority Research Programme â€œOcean & Climate" FUTURISKs project, which aims to better understand coastal risks and adaptation to climate change in French tropical island overseas territories (https://futurisks.recherche.univ-lr.fr/en/projet-en/futurisks-project/).

In this context, we are looking for a highly motivated candidate for setting up a 24-month postdoctoral (ISblue) project combining in situ (spotter buoys, tide gauge, pressure sensors, GNSS buoy) and satellite altimetry (SWOT, Sentinel-3A) data analysis, as well as wave-current modelling (CROCO-WAVEWATCH 3), with the goal to unveil the complex dynamics of the extensive Rangiroa barrier-reef-lagoon system and identify the main factors responsible for extreme lagoon water levels driven by distant swell and occasional cyclones.

The candidate will be hosted at the IFREMER institute, in Brest, France, in the Laboratory for Ocean Physics and remote Sensing (LOPS), and will join the Satellite and Air-Sea Interface (SIAM) team under the supervision of Dr. Guillaume Dodet and Dr. Swen Jullien. He/She will also work in close collaboration with the other members of the FUTURISKs project and several missions will be planned in order to participate in project meetings and to collaborate with the other project members.

To be eligible to the ISblue call, the candidate should have obtained their doctoral degree within the last four years at the closing date of the call (March 31 2025) or defend their thesis before the end of 2025 and have spent a minimum of 18 months abroad (outside France) from 1 May 2022 until the start of the project. The postdoc project will start between September 2025 and March 2026. More information on https://isblue.fr/en/tous-les-appels/post-doctoral-fellowship/.

If you are interested, please send your CV to guillaume.dodet@ifremer.fr and swen.jullien@ifremer.fr before March 7 2025. Otherwise, feel free to share with anyone potentially interested.

Guillaume Dodet
