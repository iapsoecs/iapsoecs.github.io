At University of Reading, Dept. of Meteorology, jointly with the UK National Centre for Earth Observations (NCEO) we are looking for two Postdoctoral research assistants to work within the international project “Scale-aware sea-ice project – SASIP” (https://sasip-climate.github.io/) funded and supported by the Schmidt Futures foundation (https://schmidtfutures.com/).

SASIP aims at developing a truly innovative, scale-aware continuum sea ice model for climate research; one that faithfully represents sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics and that is physically sound, data-adaptive, highly parallelized and computationally efficient.

The two Postdocs will work on data assimilation for parameter estimation and on adapting data assimilation strategy to numerical models using discontinuous Galerkin methods, possibly in connection with machine learning approaches. In particular the Postdocs will be part of a large research initiative comprising several international partners and will have the opportunities to interact with several scientists and others Postdocs and PhDs within SASIP.

Please find all details together with information on how to apply at:

    Data assimilation and machine learning for parameter estimation - https://jobs.reading.ac.uk/displayjob.aspx?jobid=7714
    
    Data assimilation for discontinuous Galerkin models - https://jobs.reading.ac.uk//displayjob.aspx?jobid=7712

Deadline 11 May 2021.

Other job opportunities within SASIP can be found on the project website at:

I would appreciate if you could circulate these opportunities within your network.
