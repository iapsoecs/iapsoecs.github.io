Sun Yat-sen University, founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, has a long history of over a century. As a university directly under the Ministry of Education of China, with joint construction by the ministry and the province, Sun Yat-sen University has become a leading comprehensive modern university known nationally and internationally. It currently consists of three campuses â€” Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen, five sub-campuses, and ten affiliated hospitals. The university has a strong foundation in humanities, social sciences, and natural and medical sciences, constantly pursuing academic innovation with an international perspective, featuring "comprehensive, research-oriented, and open" characteristics. Sun Yat-sen University is striving to become a world-class university and a global academic hub.

 

The School of Marine Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University was established in 2008, located by the beautiful coast of Zhuhai. The school has an excellent academic atmosphere and a free research environment, featuring several national and provincial research platforms, including the National Engineering Research Center for South China Sea Marine Biotechnology, the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Marine Resources and Nearshore Engineering, and the Ministry of Education's Field Scientific Observation and Research Station for the Pearl River Estuary Marine Ecological Environment. The school also co-built a national key laboratory and deeply participates in the construction of the Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Provincial Laboratory (Zhuhai). A comprehensive talent training system has been established, including undergraduate programs in marine sciences, master's and doctoral programs in first-level disciplines (including international students), and a postdoctoral research station. The overall level of the first-level discipline ranked third in the nation in the Ministry of Education's fourth-round evaluation.
