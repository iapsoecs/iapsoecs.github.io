We are pleased to advertise job opportunity to work as a postdoctoral researcher on high-resolution climate modelling at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. 

We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented researcher to investigate the role of mesoscale ocean eddies on the North Atlantic atmospheric circulation and its ultimate impacts on European extreme events. This job will contribute to the European projects EERIE and EXPECT and will entail performing and analysing simulations at ground-breaking resolutions with an eddy-resolving configuration of a global climate model based on IFS-NEMO. 

The deadline for applications is the 31st of December 2023. 

Further details are provided in the offer published at the BSC site: https://www.bsc.es/join-us/job-opportunities/55523escvcr2
