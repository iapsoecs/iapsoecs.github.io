We have two upcoming postdoctoral positions at the Univ. of East Anglia (UEA), UK, to work on estimates of air-sea greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, N2O, CH4), as part of the Horizon Europe GreenFeedBack consortium ("Greenhouse Gas Fluxes and Earth System Feedbacks").

- A 3-year position to work on the inverse modelling of air-sea GHG fluxes. Details here:  https://myview.uea.ac.uk/webrecruitment/pages/vacancy.jsf?vacancyRef=RA2059

- A linked 2-year position to work on bottom-up parameterizations of air-sea GHG fluxes. Details here: https://myview.uea.ac.uk/webrecruitment/pages/vacancy.jsf?vacancyRef=RA2058

Application deadline for both positions is Jan. 16th, 2023.
