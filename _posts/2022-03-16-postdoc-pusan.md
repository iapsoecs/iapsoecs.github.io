Postdoctoral Fellow Position â€“ Multi-year earth system predictability

Employer: IBS Center for Climate Physics
Location: Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea
Education Level: PhD
Job type: Postdoctoral Fellow or Assistant Research Fellow, depending on research experience
Salary: 54-70 million KRW/year (~45,000-60,000 USD)
Term: Full Time, 2 year, with possibility for renewal

Applicants for this position should have a PhD in physics, climate sciences, meteorology, oceanography or a
related field. Candidates are expected to have strong computational skills, excitement to work on a new
research subject, a good publication record, a high level of independence, curiosity and creativity, and
an interest in working in an international and interdisciplinary research environment. The successful

and major modes of climate variability.

The IBS Center for Climate Physics (ICCP), (http://iccp.ibs.re.kr) directed by Dr. Axel Timmermann,
is dedicated to advancing the understanding of natural climate variability, man-made climate change
and their impacts on the hydrological cycle, regional processes, ice-sheets, and sea level. The ICCP
is generously funded through the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) (http://ibs.re.kr).

ICCP is located in Busan, the second largest city in South Korea and the ninth largest port city
in the world. Surrounded by ocean and mountains, the city has a dramatic natural background. From
