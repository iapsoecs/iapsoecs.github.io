We, the sea ice physics section of Alfred-Wegener-Institut in Bremerhaven, Germany, are recruiting an engineer on under-ice robotics and sea ice physics. Measurements based on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) and autonomous platforms (buoys) are a key component in addition to classical in-situ observations. Instruments and sensor platforms for sea ice and ocean research are often prototypes and need substantial amounts of original design, development, configuration and testing.

The successful candidate will, as part of a team, develop and deploy new under-ice ROV and other robotic systems. Integration of different vehicles with control infrastructure, various scientific sensors, and data-handling software will be a key task. These systems will complement the existing under-ice ROV Beast of the Alfred-Wegener-Institut. In addition, the successful candidate is expected to participate in weeks-long expeditions to the Arctic Ocean, is responsible operating the developed instrumentation and platforms, and for maintaining and repairing other scientific instruments and equipment required for the investigations.
