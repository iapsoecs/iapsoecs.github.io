At IMAU, Utrecht University, we have an open PostDoc position in regional polar climate modelling. The position is full time (80 to 100%) and for 2 years with a planned extension of 1 year. The envisaged starting date is 1st of September 2023.

 

In this project, you will study the complex polar atmosphere-ocean-ice system from an atmospheric perspective. To do this, you will run the state-of-the-art regional climate model RACMO for the present and future and analyse and publish the results in scientific journals. For the future projections, output of global climate models with different patterns of climate change, so called storylines, will be used. The model results obtained will shed new light on various aspects of the polar climate system, such as ice and water clouds, the hydrological cycle and the surface mass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets. A strong background in climate science and the ability to work with climate models and critically assess their output are vital for a successful execution of this project.
