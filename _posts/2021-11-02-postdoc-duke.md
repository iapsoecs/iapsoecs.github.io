The Climate Dynamics Lab at Duke University is seeking a postdoctoral
scholar to work on coupled climate dynamics. The main goal of the project
is to understand the role of air-sea coupling in global climate change and
variability by combining theory, observations, and climate modeling. The
topics of the project are flexible and include, for example, global warming
pattern formation, ocean inter-basin teleconnection, El Nino dynamics, and
paleoclimate. A PhD in physical oceanography, atmospheric science, or
related fields is required. Experience with climate modeling (e.g., CESM or
similar GCMs) is highly desirable. The position will be awarded for one
year with a flexible starting date and extended by one or two more years
contingent on satisfactory performance.

Please apply at https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/20169 with a CV, a
research statement, and contact information for three references. For
questions, please contact Prof. Shineng Hu at shineng.hu@duke.edu.
Applications will be reviewed starting on November 1, 2021, but the
position will remain open until filled. Shortlisted candidates will be
contacted to discuss further the details of the project.
