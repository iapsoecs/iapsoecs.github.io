As coastal sea-levels rise, flooding will increasingly impact coastal
communities. The NSF funded EPSCOR project, the Community-Driven Coastal Climate
Research & Solutions for the Resilience of New England Coastal Populations,
seeks to help communities manage the increasing environmental risks caused
by a changing climate.

As part of this project, the Ocean Process Analysis Laboratory and the
Institute for Earth, Ocean and Space at the University of New Hampshire is
seeking a postdoctoral fellow to research the linkages between shelf-scale
sea-level, surface wave and wind fields and coastal flooding on a human
scale. The goal is to downscale the prediction of shelf-scale and
climate-scale coastal models to the human scale of harbors and
neighborhoods.

The term of this project is 2.5 years (1 year term with possibility of
renewal). The focus of this project will be the high-resolution numerical
modeling that links shelf scale forcing to human scale sea-level
predictions, the validation of that modeling, and the use of
machine-learning tools to predict sea-level and other environmental
stressors from larger scale models. Experience in physical oceanography and
numerical modeling are required. Experience with unstructured mesh
numerical models and machine learning would be helpful. Expected duties
include submission of results for publication in refereed journals,
documenting modeling code and products, and collaborating with other
researchers in this project at Brown University, the University of Rhode
Island, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and elsewhere to further the
goals of this project.

Questions can be sent to Jamie Pringle at jpringle@unh.edu. Details and
