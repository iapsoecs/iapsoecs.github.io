The Earth System Complexity group at AWI-Potsdam invites applications for a PhD position focused on coupled ice-ocean modeling. The overall goal of this PhD project is to assess the behavior and stability of the Atlantic Meridional Oceanic Circulation (AMOC) on long timescales (centuries to millennia). To do so, you will work to improve and validate a unique ocean model that is physically robust and computationally fast within a fast Earth system model. The position is funded for 3 years starting in May 2024 or shortly thereafter. Please find more details here:
