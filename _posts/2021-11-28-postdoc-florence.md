In the frame of the HPC Training and Research for Earth Sciences (HPC-TRES) program, CNR-LAMMA has opened a position for an Ocean Modeller to support a research activity aimed at studying the evolution of chlorophyll fronts in the Mediterranean Sea by integrating high-resolution ocean models and HF radars.
In particular, the activity will consist of:
1) Implementation, calibration and validation of a combined physical-biogeochemical model of the North-Western Mediterranean Sea (NWMED) with a focus on the Pelagos Sanctuary area.
2) Application of procedures for the reduction of uncertainty through Data Assimilation, using satellite data (e.g. SST, chlorophyll) and HF radar data available on the NWMED.
3) Study of the evolution of chlorophyll fronts through the comparison between models and satellite data, and application of cetacean feeding habitat models on model data.

The grant is co-funded by OGS through the HPC-TRES program. The research activity is part of line A8 “Study of the evolution of chlorophyll fronts through high-resolution models, HF radars and data assimilation” described in detail in the scientific plan of the HPC-TRES program.
The location is CNR-LAMMA, Florence (Italy), and the initial appointment is for 2 years.
