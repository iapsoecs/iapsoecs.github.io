The new NCAS group based at the University of St Andrews is seeking to appoint two Research Scientists to work on atmospheric and climate dynamics, broadly defined. These are open-ended (i.e., permanent) research positions.

 

An ideal candidate would have both excellent computational skills (in climate modelling OR machine learning/AI techniques) and a strong understanding of physical climate or atmospheric science.

  

I would be grateful if you could share this opportunity with anyone you think it might be of interest to. The link to the ad is here:

Application deadline is 7th October and interested candidates should get in touch with Dr Ioana Colfescu (ic98@st-andrews.ac.uk) for informal discussion about the positions.
