*POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN ANTARCTIC MARINE SCIENCE – New Zealand (Otago)*

    We are seeking a Postdoctoral Fellow to contribute to the
    Marsden-funded research project ‘How vulnerable are Antarctica’s
    coasts to colonisation’. In this role you will work on a project
    that will bring together interdisciplinary approaches in genomic,
    ecological, physiological, and oceanographic / sea ice modelling to
    build a comprehensive picture of the scale of biological incursions
    to Antarctica via macroalgal rafting.

    This position represents an exciting opportunity to join one of the
    country’s most research-intensive Universities and become part of a
    team helping to lead Antarctic research in New Zealand.

    */Your skills and experience/*

    The successful candidate will bring high-level computational skills
    in EITHER genomic (bioinformatic) analyses OR physical environmental
    modelling (oceanographic particle dispersal / modelling coastal
    polynya / habitat modelling with climate change).

    In addition, the successful candidate will be expected to have:
    •    A PhD in relevant field.
    •    Proven track record of high-quality research outputs such as peer-reviewed papers.
    •    Research experience in evolutionary biology, physical oceanography or habitat modelling.
    •    Good organisational skills and the ability to keep accurate records.
    •    Ability to work well as part of a team, as well as independently.
    •    Knowledge and respect for the Treaty of Waitangi and its relevance in a university setting.

    Expertise in any of the following areas could be an advantage:
    •    Molecular laboratory skills, especially Genotyping by Sequencing library preparation.
    •    Marine biology.
    •    Antarctic research.

    */Further details/*

    This is a fixed term (three years), full-time position available
    from March 2021 (mid-2021 at the latest) or a date to be mutually
    agreed with the successful candidate.
