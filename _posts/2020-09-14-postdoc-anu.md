This is a fixed-term position available for up to 3 years.

We are seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher to drive the next steps in modelling nonlinear wave propagation through sea ice, wave-induced ice breakup, and resulting ice dynamics. The project involves mathematical modelling, implementation in large-scale prediction models, and assessments against field measurements. The successful candidate will interact with an international team spanning Australia, New Zealand and the USA. Opportunities are available for domestic and international travel, to participate in conferences and for research visits.
