### Previous Events

## 28th IUGG General Assembly, Berlin, Germany

Three events have been co-organized by IAPSO ECS during the latest IUGG general assembly in July 2023.

*1) Geo.X & IUGG Early Career Scientists summer meeting – 14th July 2023 19:00-21:30, at TU Berlin*

The Geo.X Research Network for Geosciences in Berlin and Potsdam invited interested early career scientists within the network and those attending the IUGG meeting 2023 to join them for their summer gathering. This social event took place on a rooftop at the Technical University Berlin, and IAPSO ECS participated in the event organisation. About 80 participants engaged in scientific speed dating and relaxed discussions over drinks and vegan food. The event fostered networking and discussions across disciplines and backgrounds.

*2) IUGG ECS social – 15th July 18:30-20:30, in CityCube Berlin*

The main IUGG ECS event was organised by ECS representatives from the sub-organisations of the IUGG, including IAPSO. It was a free social event, open to all individuals identifying as early career. It brought together ECSs from various disciplines within IUGG. Participants had the opportunity to anonymously contribute opinions, questions, and thoughts for the panel discussion on the next day's Big Theme, while enjoying an informal evening with their peers.

*3) Early Career Scientists: Needs, Wishes and Demands (Big Theme) – 16th July 12:15-13:15, in Hall A3 CityCube Berlin*

This Big Theme event, led by the IUGG Secretary General Alexander Rudloff, consisted of a panel discussion with early-career members of each IUGG sub-organisation. Output from the ECS social event was used as a starting point for discussion. The discussion covered questions such as “What does IUGG need to adapt to support ECS in the 21st century?”, and “How do different associations include ECS within their activities?”. We hope that the output of these discussions will inform the IUGG counsel as part of their planning for the next 4 years.

## IAPSO ECS session at VACO-21

During VACO-21 (July 19 - 23, 2021), the IAPSO Early Career Network offered a session focused on different career paths and challenges that early career scientists may face. It started with a brief introduction from the chairs of the IAPSO ECS working group, Alejandra Sanchez-Franks and Malin Ödalen, followed by the keynote speakers, Julia Gottschalk and Katelin Childers.

Drs. Gottschalk and Childers both have PhDs in marine science but have followed different career paths in academia and industry, respectively. They shared their career stories, talked about obstacles and choices they have faced, and shared advice many useful pieces of advice. The recordings are no longer available - please come along to our future events for more career discussions!

## 27th IUGG General Assembly, Montreal, Canada

The first IAPSO early career networking event took place on July 9, 2019 -- the birthday of the IAPSO ECS network. Early career scientists came together to meet each other as well as representatives of the ECS network and IAPSO executive committees.
